  "reasoning": "-2 (Infeasible) because a 3 V open-circuit voltage in a single-junction cell under AM1.5G implies an ultra-wide bandgap (Eg \u2273 3.5 eV), which limits absorptance to deep-UV photons (~2\u20133% of the spectrum). The resulting Jsc ceiling (~2\u20133 mA/cm\u00b2 even at 100% EQE) caps the theoretical PCE at ~6\u20137% with a generous FF, far below the claimed 20%. This is a fundamental Shockley\u2013Queisser/spectral-flux contradiction under the stated conditions.\n\nClaim minima:\n- Single junction under AM1.5G, 1 sun, 25 \u00b0C.\n- Voc = 3 V \u2192 requires Eg \u2273 3.5 eV (radiative limit Voc \u2248 0.8\u20130.85 Eg).\n- PCE = 20% \u2192 with Voc = 3 V and FF ~0.85 requires Jsc \u2248 7.8 mA/cm\u00b2.\n- All simultaneously true.\n\nEvidence (matching conditions):\n- Direct theory: AM1.5G photon flux above 3.5 eV is ~2\u20133% \u2192 Jsc \u2264 2\u20133 mA/cm\u00b2 (contradicts required ~7.8 mA/cm\u00b2).\n- Calculated max PCE \u2248 (3 V \u00d7 2.5 mA/cm\u00b2 \u00d7 0.85) / 100 mW/cm\u00b2 \u2248 6\u20137%.\n- Literature precedent: no single-junction Eg > 3 eV devices near 20% under 1 sun AM1.5G.\n\nWhy not other scores:\n- Not \u20131: the obstacle is fundamental, not a tunable range error.\n- Not 0: decisive, condition-matched theoretical bound rules it out.\n- Not +1/+2: violates detailed-balance limits under stated conditions.\n\nAssumptions/limits:\n- Single junction, no concentration (1 sun), standard AM1.5G, 25 \u00b0C; using optimistic FF and radiative-limit Voc\u2013Eg relation. Any rescue would require changing conditions (e.g., tandem, UV-rich illumination, or >1 sun), which the claim does not allow.",
