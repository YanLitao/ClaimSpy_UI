Given typical measurement uncertainty in solar cell characterization (~\u00b10.5% absolute), we require PCE \u2265 19.5% to support the claim.\n  - For Voc: The claim states 3 V. This is the critical constraint. For single-junction cells, Voc is fundamentally limited by the bandgap (Eg) via Voc < Eg/q, where q is elementary charge. Typical high-quality cells achieve Voc \u2248 0.4-0.9 \u00d7 Eg/q. For Voc = 3 V, we need Eg \u2265 3 eV (absolute minimum), more realistically Eg \u2265 3.5-4 eV.\n</ClaimCard>\n\n<VerbMapping>\n\"Achieves\" \u2192 existential claim: there exists at least one device configuration/realization that reaches the stated metrics under the specified conditions. We do not need to prove this is typical or universal, only that it is physically plausible and not contradicted by fundamental limits.\n</VerbMapping>\n\n<MetricIntegrity>\nThe claim specifies two FoMs:\n1. **PCE (\u03b7)**: Directly stated as 20%. This is the primary performance metric.\n2. **Voc**: Directly stated as 3 V. This is a critical constraint.\n\nBoth are standard, well-defined photovoltaic metrics. No proxy is needed. The relationship between them involves the Shockley-Queisser (SQ) limit and detailed balance, which depends on the bandgap Eg.\n\n**Critical issue:** For a single-junction cell, Voc and PCE are coupled through the bandgap. The SQ limit shows:\n- Maximum PCE occurs at Eg \u2248 1.1-1.4 eV (PCE_max \u2248 33%)\n- At Eg = 3 eV, SQ limit PCE \u2248 20-25% (depending on exact Eg)\n- At Eg = 4 eV, SQ limit PCE \u2248 10-15%\n\nThe claim of Voc = 3 V with PCE = 20% creates a tension: high Voc requires large Eg, but large Eg reduces maximum achievable PCE due to poor solar spectrum utilization.\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\n**Available tools:**\n1. **search_tool**: Can find literature on solar cell performance limits, SQ limits, record efficiencies, and Voc-Eg relationships.\n2. **calphad**: Thermodynamic phase equilibria tool - NOT applicable to semiconductor device physics or photovoltaic performance.\n3. **chgnet_mlip**: Atomistic structure/energy tool - NOT directly applicable to device-level photovoltaic performance, though could provide bandgaps in principle.\n\n**Representation assessment:**\n- Neither computational tool (calphad, chgnet_mlip) is designed for or capable of computing device-level solar cell performance (PCE, Voc under illumination).\n- The claim is fundamentally about **device physics and the Shockley-Queisser limit**, not about crystal structure, phase stability, or atomistic energetics.\n- **search_tool** is the only appropriate tool to:\n  a) Establish the theoretical SQ limit for single-junction cells as a function of bandgap\n  b) Determine what bandgap is required for Voc = 3 V\n  c) Check if 20% PCE is achievable at that bandgap\n  d) Identify if any wide-bandgap semiconductors have demonstrated such performance\n\n**Conclusion:** This claim is **outside the scope** of calphad and chgnet_mlip. We must rely on search_tool to access the relevant device physics literature and theoretical limits.\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n**Units:**\n- PCE: dimensionless, reported as % (0.20 in fractional form)\n- Voc: volts (V)\n- Bandgap Eg: electron-volts (eV)\n- Illumination: 1000 W/m\u00b2 = 1 sun (AM 1.5G spectrum)\n- Temperature: 25\u00b0C = 298 K\n\n**Key relationship:** Voc < Eg/q, where q = 1.602\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 C (elementary charge). When Eg is in eV and Voc in V, the numerical values are directly comparable: Voc < Eg (numerically).\n\n**Baseline validation:** We should verify that known solar cell records align with SQ theory:\n- Si (Eg \u2248 1.1 eV): record PCE \u2248 26%, Voc \u2248 0.74 V \u2713\n- GaAs (Eg \u2248 1.4 eV): record PCE \u2248 29%, Voc \u2248 1.1 V \u2713\n- Perovskites (Eg \u2248 1.5-1.6 eV): PCE \u2248 25%, Voc \u2248 1.2 V \u2713\n\nThese should match SQ predictions within reasonable loss factors.\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n**Stop rules (existential claim):**\n1. If we find that Voc = 3 V requires Eg \u2265 3.5 eV, AND at Eg = 3.5 eV the SQ limit PCE < 20%, the claim is **infeasible** \u2192 STOP.\n2. If we find that the SQ limit at the required Eg allows PCE \u2265 20%, but no known wide-bandgap semiconductor has demonstrated anything close, the claim is **plausible but unverified** \u2192 may need one more search for material candidates.\n3. If we find fundamental physics violations (e.g., Voc > Eg), the claim is **infeasible** \u2192 STOP.\n\n**Test sequence:**\n1. **Search 1:** Query for \"Shockley-Queisser limit bandgap 3 eV efficiency\" or \"single junction solar cell Voc 3V bandgap requirement\" to establish:\n   - What Eg is needed for Voc = 3 V\n   - What is the SQ limit PCE at that Eg\n   \n2. **Decision point:** If SQ limit < 20% at required Eg, STOP (infeasible). If SQ limit \u2265 20%, proceed.\n\n3. **Search 2 (if needed):** Query for wide-bandgap solar cells (Eg > 3 eV) and their demonstrated performance to check if any real materials approach the claim.\n\n**Budget:** 2-3 search queries maximum should suffice.\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n<ToolPlan>\n**Plan:**\n1. Use **search_tool** (query 1) to establish the fundamental relationship between Voc, bandgap, and the Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit. Specifically:\n   - What bandgap is required to achieve Voc = 3 V in a single-junction cell?\n   - What is the maximum theoretical PCE at that bandgap according to SQ theory?\n\n2. **Decision point:** \n   - If SQ limit PCE < 20% at the required Eg \u2192 claim is **infeasible** (violates fundamental physics) \u2192 STOP\n   - If SQ limit PCE \u2265 20% at the required Eg \u2192 claim is **theoretically possible** \u2192 proceed to check material reality\n\n3. Use **search_tool** (query 2, if needed) to identify:\n   - Are there any wide-bandgap semiconductors (Eg \u2265 3 eV) that have demonstrated high PCE?\n   - What are the record Voc values for wide-bandgap solar cells?\n\n**Rationale:** \n- The claim is fundamentally about device physics limits, not atomistic structure or thermodynamics.\n- Neither calphad nor chgnet_mlip can compute device-level photovoltaic performance.\n- The SQ limit provides a hard upper bound that is well-established in the literature.\n- This is the most cost-effective approach (2-3 searches vs. attempting inappropriate computational tools).\n</ToolPlan>\n\nNow I will execute the plan, starting with the first search query to establish the fundamental limits.",
