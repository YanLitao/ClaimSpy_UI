  "reasoning": "-1 (Partially Infeasible) because there is no direct, condition\u2011matched evidence that Ga increases fracture toughness of Fe alloys, and available indications lean against enhancement (qualitative reports emphasize \u201cmaintains\u201d toughness rather than improvement; a cited computation hints at reduced energetic stability with Ga).\n\nClaim decomposition (minima that must all hold):\n- A) Ga can be incorporated into Fe alloy at some concentration relevant to bulk mechanical testing.\n- B) Under typical ambient testing conditions, K_Ic for Fe\u2013Ga exceeds the baseline (pure Fe or matched Fe alloy) by a measurable margin.\n- C) The enhancement is demonstrated under matched composition, microstructure, and test protocols.\n\nEvidence mapping:\n- Direct (matching K_Ic measurements vs. baseline): None found.\n- Indirect/proxy: Reviews describe Fe\u2013Ga as mechanically \u201crobust\u201d/\u201cgood,\u201d which supports adequacy, not enhancement; a DFT study suggests Ga doping reduces energetic stability (a proxy that could correlate with reduced fracture resistance).\n- Contradictions/negative weight: Informative absence of K_Ic\u2011enhancement reports in a well\u2011studied system (Galfenol) where such a benefit would likely be noted if present.\n\nWhy not other scores:\n- Not \u20132: No fundamental barrier prevents Ga from ever improving toughness in a narrow window; it\u2019s not thermodynamically impossible.\n- Not 0: The balance of evidence leans against enhancement (not merely unknown), given lack of direct support and hints of adverse effects.\n- Not +1/+2: No direct, quantitative K_Ic enhancement data under matched conditions.\n\nAssumptions/limitations:\n- Ambient testing assumed; \u201cenhances\u201d interpreted as measurable increase over pure Fe or a matched reference Fe alloy.\n- Microstructure and processing strongly affect K_Ic; absence of matched-condition data is the critical gap.",
