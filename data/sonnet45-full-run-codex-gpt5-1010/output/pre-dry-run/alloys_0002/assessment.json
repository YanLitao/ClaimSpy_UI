      "text": "The claim asserts that gallium doping enhances fracture toughness of iron alloy. This is an existential claim requiring at least one documented case where Fe-Ga demonstrates measurably higher fracture toughness (K_IC) than baseline pure Fe under matched conditions. Three targeted literature searches of the Fe-Ga system were conducted to find such evidence.",
