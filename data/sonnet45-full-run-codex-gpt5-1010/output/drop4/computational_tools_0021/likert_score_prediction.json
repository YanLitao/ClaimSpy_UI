  "reasoning": "+2 (Feasible) because condition-matched CALPHAD using a validated Fe\u2013Al database (COST 507) predicts exactly the two equilibrium solid phases stated (Al5Fe2 and Al2Fe) at 750 K and 30 at.% Fe, with substantial fractions and correct mass balance; this aligns with established Fe\u2013Al phase diagram topology in the 28.6\u201333.3 at.% Fe window.\n\n- Claim decomposition (minima):\n  - Composition: 30 at.% Fe / 70 at.% Al\n  - Temperature: 750 K\n  - Equilibrium, solid state\n  - Phase assemblage: exactly two phases, Al5Fe2 + Al2Fe\n- Evidence:\n  - Direct (matching conditions): CALPHAD (COST 507) \u2192 Al5Fe2 (~70%) + Al2Fe (~30%), sums to unity; lever rule checks\n  - Indirect corroboration: Fe\u2013Al binary diagrams place 70 at.% Al between Fe2Al5 (71.43% Al) and FeAl2 (66.67% Al), implying a two-phase field at these temperatures\n  - No contradictions reported\n- Why not other scores:\n  - Not +1: all necessary elements are directly evidenced under matched conditions\n  - Not 0/\u20131/\u20132: no ambiguity, no range overreach, and no thermodynamic contradiction\n- Assumptions/limits: Relies on accuracy of the COST 507 database and equilibrium assumption; trace phases below significance threshold are neglected.",
