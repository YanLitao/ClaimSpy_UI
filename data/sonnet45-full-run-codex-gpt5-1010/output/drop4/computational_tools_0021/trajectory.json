For \"two-phase,\" exactly two phases should have significant fractions (\u22651%), with all others negligible.\n    </ClaimCard>\n    \n    <VerbMapping>\n    \"results thermodynamically in\" \u2192 at thermodynamic equilibrium, the system exhibits this phase assemblage. This is a deterministic claim about equilibrium state, not a kinetic or metastable statement. The verb \"results in\" combined with \"thermodynamically\" maps to: compute equilibrium phase fractions at (T=750K, x_Fe=0.30) and verify that (a) exactly two phases are present with significant fractions, and (b) those phases are Al5Fe2 and Al2Fe.\n    </VerbMapping>\n    \n    <MetricIntegrity>\n    The FoM is **phase assemblage** (which phases are stable and their fractions) at equilibrium. CALPHAD directly computes this via Gibbs energy minimization. No proxy is needed; the tool outputs phase names and fractions directly. I will verify:\n    1. Number of phases with fraction \u2265 0.01 (1%) equals 2\n    2. The two phases are Al5Fe2 and Al2Fe\n    3. Their combined fraction \u2248 1.0 (within numerical tolerance)\n    </MetricIntegrity>\n    \n    <RepresentationGate>\n    **CALPHAD** is the appropriate tool:\n    - It represents Fe-Al binary system thermodynamics via assessed databases (e.g., COST507, SGTE, or similar)\n    - It can compute equilibrium phase fractions at specified T and composition\n    - It includes intermetallic phases like Al5Fe2 (also written as Al\u2085Fe\u2082) and Al2Fe (Al\u2082Fe or FeAl\u2082)\n    - The temperature (750 K) and composition (30 at.% Fe) are well within the Fe-Al binary system range\n    \n    **Representation check**: CALPHAD databases for Fe-Al typically include:\n    - Terminal solid solutions: fcc-Al, bcc-Fe\n    - Intermetallic compounds: FeAl (B2), Fe3Al (D03), FeAl2, Fe2Al5, FeAl3, and others\n    \n    The phases Al5Fe2 and Al2Fe correspond to:\n    - Al5Fe2: stoichiometry 71.4 at.% Al, 28.6 at.% Fe\n    - Al2Fe: stoichiometry 66.7 at.% Al, 33.3 at.% Fe\n    \n    The claim composition (70 at.% Al, 30 at.% Fe) lies between these two stoichiometries, which is consistent with a two-phase region in a binary phase diagram. CALPHAD should represent this region if the database includes these phases.\n    \n    **Potential issue**: Phase nomenclature varies. Al5Fe2 might be labeled as \"Fe2Al5\" or similar in some databases. I will need to check the actual phase names returned and map them to stoichiometry.\n    </RepresentationGate>\n    \n    <UnitsAndBaseline>\n    - **Temperature**: 750 K (input directly; no conversion needed)\n    - **Composition**: 30 at.% Fe = mole fraction x_Fe = 0.30, x_Al = 0.70\n    - **Phase fractions**: dimensionless (mole fraction or volume fraction), range [0, 1]\n    \n    **Baseline validation**: I will check that:\n    1. At 70 at.% Al, 298 K, the system should show Al-rich phases (likely fcc-Al + intermetallic)\n    2. At 50 at.% Fe (equiatomic), 750 K, the system should show FeAl (B2) or related phases\n    3. Phase fractions sum to 1.0 within tolerance (\u00b10.01)\n    \n    If baseline checks fail, I will flag uncertainty in the database or setup.\n    </UnitsAndBaseline>\n    \n    <MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n    **Primary test**: Single CALPHAD equilibrium calculation at T=750K, x_Fe=0.30, P=1 atm.\n    \n    **Output to verify**:\n    1. List of phases with fraction > 0.01\n    2. Identification of those phases (names/stoichiometry)\n    3. Phase fractions\n    \n    **Decisive criteria**:\n    - **Support**: Exactly 2 phases present with fractions \u22650.01, identified as Al5Fe2 and Al2Fe (or stoichiometric equivalents)\n    - **Refute**: \n      - More or fewer than 2 phases present\n      - The two phases are not Al5Fe2 and Al2Fe\n      - One of the claimed phases is absent or has negligible fraction\n    \n    **Sensitivity check**: If the result is borderline (e.g., a third phase with fraction ~0.01-0.05), I will note this as a boundary condition and evaluate whether it contradicts the \"two-phase\" claim.\n    \n    **Stop rule**: \n    - If CALPHAD returns exactly the claimed two phases with significant fractions and no others, the claim is **Supported** \u2192 STOP.\n    - If CALPHAD returns a different phase assemblage (different phases or different number of phases), the claim is **Refuted** \u2192 STOP.\n    - If CALPHAD cannot represent the phases or fails, return **Not Represented** \u2192 STOP.\n    </MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n### Tool Plan\n\n<ToolPlan>\n**Primary tool**: CALPHAD (cost 5, 1 call allowed)\n\n**Rationale**: \n- The claim is purely thermodynamic (equilibrium phase assemblage)\n- CALPHAD directly computes equilibrium phases via Gibbs energy minimization\n- No kinetics, barriers, or mechanical properties are involved\n- The Fe-Al system is well-studied and should be in standard databases\n\n**Sequence**:\n1. Call CALPHAD with T=750K, composition=30 at.% Fe, 70 at.% Al\n2. Parse output for phase names and fractions\n3. Verify the claim: exactly 2 phases, identified as Al5Fe2 and Al2Fe\n4. If result is clear (supports or refutes), STOP\n5. If result is ambiguous (e.g., nomenclature mismatch, boundary condition), use 1 search query to clarify Fe-Al phase diagram at this composition/temperature\n\n**Search tool** (cost 3, up to 3 calls): \n- **Conditional use**: Only if CALPHAD output is ambiguous or needs validation\n- Query: \"Fe-Al phase diagram 30 at% Fe 750K equilibrium phases\" or similar\n- Purpose: Cross-check phase assemblage, clarify nomenclature (Al5Fe2 vs Fe2Al5), or verify if this is a known two-phase region\n\n**Decision**: Start with CALPHAD. It is the most direct and authoritative tool for this claim. Search will be used only if needed for clarification or cross-validation.\n</ToolPlan>\n\n### Execution Plan\n\nI will now call the CALPHAD tool with the claim parameters. The question I will pose to the tool is clear: \"At 750 K and composition 30 at.% Fe, 70 at.% Al, what are the equilibrium phases and their fractions in the Fe-Al system?\"\n\nThis single call should be decisive for this thermodynamic equilibrium claim.",

Target FoM & Units**: Phase assemblage (qualitative: which phases present) and phase fractions (quantitative: mole fractions, dimensionless, range 0-1).\n\n**5. Plan**: Single CALPHAD equilibrium calculation at T=750K, x_Fe=0.30. Verify that exactly two phases (Al\u2085Fe\u2082 and Al\u2082Fe) are present with significant fractions.\n\n**6.

Synthesis**: \nThe CALPHAD calculation using the COST 507 database yields exactly the claimed phase assemblage: a two-phase mixture of Al\u2085Fe\u2082 (70 mol%) and Al\u2082Fe (30 mol%) at 750 K and 30 at.% Fe. The phase fractions satisfy the lever rule for the given composition. No other phases are present above the stability threshold. The result is unambiguous and directly confirms the claim.\n\n**8. Score & Rationale**: \n**STRONGLY SUPPORTED**. The CALPHAD calculation, using a validated thermodynamic database, confirms that at 750 K and 30 at.% Fe / 70 at.% Al, the equilibrium state consists of exactly two phases: Al\u2085Fe\u2082 and Al\u2082Fe, with substantial fractions (0.70 and 0.30 respectively).

What would change the score**: \n- A different thermodynamic database yielding a different phase assemblage (e.g., three phases or different phases) would require reconciliation\n- Experimental phase analysis (XRD, microscopy) at exactly these conditions showing different phases\n- Discovery that COST 507 has known errors in this composition/temperature region\n\nHowever, given the clarity of the result and the established validity of the database, the current assessment is highly confident.",
