  "reasoning": "+1 (Partially Feasible) because a direct, condition-matched CHGNet NEB calculation for Au adatom diffusion on a clean Al(111) slab gives a barrier well below 0.2 eV, and the physical rationale (high mobility of noble metals on close-packed sp-metal surfaces) is consistent. However, the claim is stated broadly (\u201con aluminum surfaces\u201d) while the evidence covers only a single facet (111), a single path/coverage, and ideal UHV/clean conditions with one MLIP model; no DFT/experimental validation or facet/oxide dependence is provided.\n\nClaim decomposition (minima that must hold):\n- Entity/property: Au adatom surface diffusion barrier on Al surfaces < 0.2 eV.\n- Conditions: Facet, cleanliness (oxide vs. clean), coverage, temperature; claim implies generality across \u201caluminum surfaces.\u201d\n- Scope: Universal-ish statement; at least typical Al surfaces should satisfy the threshold.\n\nEvidence:\n- Direct (matching for a subset): CHGNet NEB on clean Al(111) 3\u00d73\u00d74 slab \u2192 Ed \u2248 0.00 \u00b1 0.05 eV (< 0.2 eV).\n- Indirect/proxy: Mechanistic plausibility for low barriers on fcc(111) surfaces; known high mobility trends for noble metals on simple metal substrates.\n- Potential gaps/contradictions: None presented, but other facets (e.g., Al(100)/(110)), step edges, higher coverages, and native oxide (common in ambient) could raise barriers above 0.2 eV; single-model dependence.\n\nWhy not +2:\n- Broad claim vs. narrow evidence (one facet, one model); no DFT/experimental confirmation; no survey across surfaces or realistic oxide.\nWhy not 0:\n- We have direct, condition-aligned modeling showing strong margin under a reasonable interpretation (clean Al(111)).\nWhy not \u20131/\u20132:\n- No fundamental contradiction; mechanism and one direct calculation support the effect.\n\nAssumptions/limitations:\n- Interprets \u201caluminum surfaces\u201d as clean metallic facets in vacuum; adatom diffusion pathway; dilute coverage.\n- Single MLIP result; kinetics and facet/defect/oxide variability not mapped.",
