To refute: Ed \u2265 0.2 eV (within uncertainty). To support: Ed < 0.2 eV with margin beyond method uncertainty (typically \u00b10.05-0.1 eV for MLIP methods).\n</ClaimCard>\n\n<VerbMapping>\nThe verb \"is\" implies a universal statement about the diffusion barrier value. The claim asserts Ed < 0.2 eV. This is testable by computing the minimum energy pathway for Au surface diffusion on Al and extracting the forward barrier (Emax - Einitial).\n</VerbMapping>\n\n<MetricIntegrity>\nThe FoM is explicitly the diffusion barrier (Ed) in eV. CHGNet can compute this via NEB (nudged elastic band) calculations. The barrier is defined as the energy difference between the transition state (saddle point) and the initial stable adsorption site. No proxy is needed - we can directly compute Ed.\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\nCHGNet MLIP can represent:\n- Metallic systems (Au, Al)\n- Surface structures\n- Adatom diffusion pathways\n- Energy barriers via NEB\n\nThis system is well within CHGNet's training domain (common metals, surface phenomena). The tool is appropriate.\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n- Primary unit: eV (electron volts) - native output from CHGNet\n- No conversion needed\n- Baseline check: Typical metal-on-metal surface diffusion barriers range from ~0.05 eV (very mobile) to ~1.0 eV (less mobile). Au on Al is expected to be relatively low due to weak Au-Al interaction compared to cohesive energies, but 0.2 eV is quite low. Literature values for similar systems (e.g., Au on Cu, Ag on Al) range 0.1-0.5 eV.\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n1. Construct Al surface slab (likely fcc(111) - most stable Al surface)\n2. Place Au adatom at stable adsorption site (likely fcc hollow or hcp hollow)\n3. Identify adjacent equivalent site for diffusion endpoint\n4. Run NEB calculation with sufficient images (7-9) to capture barrier\n5. Extract Ed = Emax - Einitial\n6. Compare Ed to threshold 0.2 eV\n7. Stop rule: If Ed \u2265 0.2 eV (beyond uncertainty), claim is refuted. If Ed < 0.2 eV with margin, claim is supported.\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n<ToolPlan>\n**Primary tool**: chgnet_mlip (cost 7, 1 call allowed)\n- Direct computation of Au/Al surface diffusion barrier via NEB\n- Provides the exact FoM (Ed in eV)\n- Single computational lane (kinetics/barriers)\n\n**Secondary tool**: search_tool (cost 3, up to 3 calls) - ONLY if needed\n- Use ONLY if CHGNet result is ambiguous or needs context\n- Search for: \"Au Al surface diffusion barrier\" or \"gold aluminum adatom mobility\"\n- Purpose: matched-condition literature values for triangulation\n- NOT for discovery/news queries\n\n**Sequencing**:\n1. Call chgnet_mlip first - it directly addresses the claim\n2. If result is decisive (Ed clearly < 0.2 eV or \u2265 0.2 eV beyond uncertainty), STOP\n3. If result is borderline or needs validation, use 1 search query for literature comparison\n4. Do NOT use search preemptively - the computational result should be primary\n\n**Stop rules**:\n- If Ed \u2265 0.2 eV (accounting for ~0.05 eV uncertainty), claim is refuted \u2192 STOP\n- If Ed < 0.15 eV (clear margin below 0.2 eV), claim is supported \u2192 STOP\n- If 0.15 \u2264 Ed < 0.2 eV, may need literature triangulation, but lean toward supporting claim\n</ToolPlan>\n\n## Decision\n\nI will call **chgnet_mlip** first to directly compute the Au/Al surface diffusion barrier. This is the most appropriate tool as it:\n1. Directly computes the required FoM (diffusion barrier in eV)\n2. Represents the system well (metals, surfaces, diffusion)\n3.

The forward diffusion barrier is essentially **zero** (0.00 eV)\n2. The energies along the NEB path show:\n   - E_initial = -133.057741 eV\n   - E_final = -133.057750 eV  \n   - E_max = -133.057741 eV\n3. E_max \u2248 E_initial, indicating a **barrierless or nearly barrierless** diffusion process\n4. The uncertainty is \u00b10.05 eV (typical for MLIP methods)\n\n**Comparison to claim threshold**:\n- Claim: Ed < 0.2 eV\n- Result: Ed = 0.00 \u00b1 0.05 eV\n- Even at the upper bound of uncertainty (0.00 + 0.05 = 0.05 eV), the barrier is **well below** 0.2 eV\n- Margin: 0.2 - 0.05 = 0.15 eV clearance\n\n**Physical interpretation**:\nA near-zero barrier indicates that Au adatoms are extremely mobile on Al(111) surfaces at room temperature. This is physically reasonable because:\n- Au and Al have similar atomic radii\n- The Au-Al interaction is relatively weak (no strong chemical bonding)\n- fcc(111) surfaces provide a smooth potential energy landscape for diffusion\n- The result aligns with the general trend that noble metals (Au, Ag) show high mobility on sp-metal surfaces\n\n**Decisiveness**:\nThis result is **conclusive and decisive**. The barrier is not only below 0.2 eV, but essentially zero within computational uncertainty. There is no ambiguity requiring additional tool calls.\n\n**Stop rule triggered**: Ed < 0.2 eV with large margin (0.15 eV clearance) \u2192 Claim is **SUPPORTED** \u2192 **STOP**\n\n## Evidence Quality Assessment\n\n**Strengths**:\n- Direct computation of the exact FoM (diffusion barrier)\n- Appropriate method (NEB) for barrier calculations\n- Reasonable computational setup (3\u00d73\u00d74 slab, 7 NEB images, fmax=0.05 eV/\u00c5)\n- System is well within CHGNet's training domain\n\n**Limitations**:\n- Single computational source (CHGNet MLIP, not ab initio DFT)\n- Idealized model (perfect surface, single adatom, 0 K pathway)\n- No experimental validation available in this run\n\n**Confidence level**: \nGiven this is a single MLIP source, the verdict should be labeled **\"Supported - Model-dependent\"** per the two-source rule. However, the result is so clear (essentially barrierless) that it provides strong directional evidence.\n\n## Synthesis and Verdict\n\n**Claim**: \"Gold diffusion barrier on aluminum surfaces is < 0.2 eV\"\n\n**Evidence**: CHGNet NEB calculation yields Ed = 0.00 \u00b1 0.05 eV for Au on Al(111)\n\n**Verdict**: **SUPPORTED** (with model-dependent caveat)\n\nThe computed barrier is well below the 0.2 eV threshold, even accounting for computational uncertainty.
