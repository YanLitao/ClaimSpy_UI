  "reasoning": "+2 (Feasible) because multiple authoritative, condition-matched experimental sources report Ag\u2019s bulk modulus near 100 GPa at ambient conditions, directly aligning with the \u201c~100 GPa\u201d claim.\n- Claim decomposition: entity = elemental Ag (fcc), property = bulk modulus (B), magnitude = ~100 GPa, conditions = ambient; scope = general (no special environment).\n- Evidence:\n  - Direct experimental: NIST B_T \u2248 101.5 GPa and B_S \u2248 103.6 GPa; WebElements \u2248 100 GPa.\n  - Modeling (auxiliary): CHGNet \u2248 78.9 GPa (known underestimation for soft metals); does not outweigh direct measurements.\n- Why not other scores:\n  - Not +1: no critical missing element; direct, matched measurements confirm the value.\n  - Not 0/\u20131/\u20132: no contradictions or fundamental issues; the stated magnitude and conditions match consensus data.\n- Assumptions/limits: Ambient conditions and high-purity Ag; small isothermal vs adiabatic differences both near 100 GPa and consistent with \u201c~\u201d.",
