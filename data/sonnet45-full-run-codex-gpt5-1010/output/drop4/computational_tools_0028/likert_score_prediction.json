  "reasoning": "+1 (Partially Feasible) because CALPHAD at 298 K shows that adding Zn near the \u201cfew at.%\u201d range (\u22654 at.%) to the ~34.5 at.% Mg composition yields >20% \u03c4-phase, but 2 at.% Zn (often within \u201cfew\u201d) does not reach the threshold, so the claim as phrased is broader than the supported window.\n\nClaim decomposition (minima):\n- Composition: Al\u2013Mg\u2013Zn with Mg \u2248 34.5 at.% (eutectic of Al\u2013Mg), Zn added by a few at.% (interpretable as ~2\u20135 at.%).\n- Conditions: ambient temperature (implicit; CALPHAD evaluated at 298 K), equilibrium phase fractions.\n- Phenomenon: \u03c4 (ternary) phase forms with phase fraction >20%.\n\nEvidence mapping:\n- Direct (CALPHAD, 298 K, Mg fixed at ~34.5 at.%):\n  - 0 at.% Zn: 0% \u03c4 (baseline)\n  - 2 at.% Zn: 12.19% \u03c4 (below 20%)\n  - 4 at.% Zn: 31.72% \u03c4 (exceeds 20%)\n  - 6 at.% Zn: 51.24% \u03c4 (well above 20%)\n- No contradictions provided that match conditions; monotonic trend with Zn content is consistent.\n\nWhy not +2:\n- Wording \u201ca few at.%\u201d plausibly includes ~2\u20135 at.% Zn; since 2 at.% fails, the claim as stated is broader than the supported sub\u2011window (\u2248\u22654 at.%). Thus, it\u2019s feasible in a narrower slice than implied.\n\nWhy not 0 or negative:\n- There is direct, condition\u2011matched thermodynamic evidence achieving >20% \u03c4 at 4 at.% Zn; the core effect is clearly supported. Only the breadth of the \u201cfew at.%\u201d range is at issue, not the phenomenon itself.\n\nAssumptions/limitations:\n- Single CALPHAD database at 298 K; kinetic accessibility and thermal history not treated. Temperature is implicit in the claim; results may shift with T, but equilibrium support at ambient is strong.",
