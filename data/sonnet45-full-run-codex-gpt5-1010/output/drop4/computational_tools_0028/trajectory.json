Phase equilibria at the relevant composition range\n\nThe tau phase in Al-Mg-Zn is well-documented in the literature (often denoted as \u03c4 or T-phase, with approximate stoichiometry around Al\u2082Mg\u2083Zn\u2083 or similar). CALPHAD databases for this system should represent it.\n\n**Representation check:** CALPHAD is appropriate for this claim.\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n**Units:** Phase fractions are reported as percentages (%) or mole/volume fractions (0-1). Standard conversion: fraction \u00d7 100 = percentage.\n\n**Baseline validation:** \n- First, verify the eutectic composition in Al-Mg binary (~34.5 at.% Mg) is correctly represented\n- Check that at this binary composition (no Zn), the tau phase fraction is zero or negligible\n- This establishes the baseline before Zn addition\n\n**Constants:** No complex unit conversions needed for phase fractions.\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n**Test points:**\n1. **Baseline:** Al-Mg eutectic composition (~65.5 at.% Al, 34.5 at.% Mg, 0 at.% Zn) - verify tau phase is absent\n2. **Claim point 1:** ~63.5 at.% Al, 34.5 at.% Mg, 2 at.% Zn (minimal \"few percent\")\n3. **Claim point 2:** ~61.5 at.% Al, 34.5 at.% Mg, 4 at.% Zn (mid-range \"few percent\")\n4. **Claim point 3:** ~59.5 at.% Al, 34.5 at.% Mg, 6 at.% Zn (upper bound check)\n\n**Temperature:** Start with room temperature (298 K) and typical processing temperature (e.g., 400-500 K) if the first doesn't show tau phase, since \"eutectic\" suggests we're near solidification conditions.\n\n**Stop rule:** \n- If ANY of the test points with Zn addition shows tau phase fraction >20%, the existential claim is **verified** \u2192 STOP\n- If all test points show tau phase fraction <20%, the claim is **refuted**\n- If tau phase is not represented in the database, return **Not Represented**\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n<ToolPlan>\n**Single-tool strategy: CALPHAD (cost 5, 1 call allowed)**\n\nCALPHAD is the ideal and sufficient tool for this claim because:\n1. It directly computes equilibrium phase fractions (the exact FoM)\n2. It handles ternary systems and can evaluate the tau phase\n3. The claim is about thermodynamic equilibrium phase distribution\n4. No kinetic barriers are claimed - this is a phase equilibrium question\n\n**Plan:**\n- Use the single CALPHAD call to evaluate multiple composition points in one query\n- Request phase fractions at the baseline (binary eutectic) and 3-4 points with Zn additions\n- Evaluate at room temperature initially; if tau doesn't appear, may need to consider the temperature at which the eutectic solidifies\n\n**Search tool consideration:** \n- Could use search to find the exact eutectic temperature or tau phase details, but this is secondary\n- CALPHAD should provide the decisive answer directly\n- Reserve search for clarification only if CALPHAD results are ambiguous\n\n**Decision:** Start with CALPHAD. This should be sufficient to verify or refute the claim.\n</ToolPlan>\n\nNow I will proceed with the CALPHAD tool call to evaluate the phase fractions at the specified compositions.",

    "thought_1": "Excellent! The CALPHAD results provide decisive evidence. Let me analyze the findings:\n\n## Evidence Analysis\n\n**CALPHAD Results Summary:**\n- **Baseline (0 at.% Zn):** \u03c4-phase is NOT present at 298-500 K \u2713 (confirms baseline)\n- **2 at.% Zn:** \u03c4-phase fraction = 12.19% at 298 K (below 20% threshold)\n- **4 at.% Zn:** \u03c4-phase fraction = 31.72% at 298 K (EXCEEDS 20% threshold) \u2713\n- **6 at.% Zn:** \u03c4-phase fraction = 51.24% at 298 K (well above threshold)\n\n**Claim Verification:**\nThe claim states: \"adding just a few atomic percent Zn...leads to...over 20% phase fraction\"\n\n- \"A few atomic percent\" = 2-5 at.% (standard interpretation)\n- At 4 at.% Zn: 31.72% \u03c4-phase \u2713 EXCEEDS the 20% threshold\n- The CALPHAD tool notes \"\u22733-4 at.% Zn is required to achieve >20% \u03c4-phase fraction\"\n\n**Stop Rule Triggered:** This is an existential claim. We have found a composition within the \"few atomic percent Zn\" range (4 at.% Zn) that produces >20% tau phase fraction (31.72%). The claim is **VERIFIED**.\n\n## Synthesis & Scoring\n\n**Evidence Quality:**\n- Direct measurement of the exact FoM (tau phase fraction in %)\n- Appropriate tool (CALPHAD for equilibrium phase fractions)\n- Baseline validated (no tau at 0% Zn)\n- Multiple composition points evaluated\n- Results are internally consistent (monotonic increase with Zn content)\n\n**Scope Fidelity:**\n- System: Al-Mg-Zn \u2713\n- Composition: ~34.5 at.% Mg maintained \u2713\n- Zn addition: 2-6 at.% range covers \"a few atomic percent\" \u2713\n- Temperature: 298 K (room temperature equilibrium) \u2713\n- FoM: tau phase fraction in % \u2713\n\n**Quantitative Assessment:**\n- Threshold \u03b8 = 20% phase fraction\n- At 4 at.% Zn: 31.72% (exceeds threshold by 11.72 percentage points, or ~59% above threshold)\n- This is well beyond any reasonable uncertainty margin\n\n**Score: SUPPORTED**\n\nThe claim is supported by the CALPHAD calculations. Adding 4 at.% Zn (which falls within \"a few atomic percent\") to the eutectic Al-Mg composition produces 31.72% tau phase, significantly exceeding the claimed 20% threshold.\n\n**Rationale:** The computational evidence directly demonstrates that the claim's conditions (few at.% Zn addition to eutectic Al-Mg) produce the claimed outcome (>20% tau phase). The 4 at.% Zn composition point provides clear, decisive evidence. While 2 at.% Zn produces only 12.19% (below threshold), the claim uses the phrase \"a few atomic percent,\" which reasonably encompasses 3-5 at.%, and the CALPHAD results confirm that \u22733-4 at.% Zn achieves the claimed result.\n\n**What would change the score:**\n- Experimental measurements at these exact compositions showing significantly different tau phase fractions\n- Evidence that the COST507R database misrepresents the tau phase in this system\n- Clarification that \"a few\" means strictly 2-3 at.%, in which case the claim would be at the boundary (2 at.% fails, but 3-4 at.% succeeds)\n\nSince the claim is verified with decisive evidence from the appropriate computational tool, and the stop rule for existential claims is satisfied, I will now finish the task.",

  "reasoning": "Following the claim verification guideline, I conducted a systematic pre-flight analysis and executed a minimal decisive test using CALPHAD.\n\n## Pre-Flight Analysis\nThe claim asserts that adding \"a few atomic percent Zn\" (interpreted as 2-5 at.%) to the eutectic Al-Mg composition (~34.5 at.% Mg) produces >20% tau phase fraction. This is an existential claim with an explicit threshold (\u03b8 = 20%).\n\n## Tool Selection & Execution\nCALPHAD was the optimal single tool because it:\n1. Directly computes equilibrium phase fractions (exact FoM)\n2. Represents the Al-Mg-Zn ternary system including the tau phase\n3.

While 2 at.% Zn yields only 12.19% tau phase, the phrase \"a few atomic percent\" reasonably encompasses 3-5 at.%, and the computational evidence confirms that compositions in this range (specifically \u22654 at.% Zn) achieve the claimed result. The existential nature of the claim is satisfied by this decisive positive instance."
