For \"two-phase,\" exactly two phases with non-negligible fractions (e.g., each \u22651% to avoid trace impurities). The claim is binary: either this exact phase assemblage exists, or it does not.\n</ClaimCard>\n\n<VerbMapping>\n\"results thermodynamically in\" \u2192 the equilibrium phase assemblage at stated (T, x) matches the claim exactly. This is a deterministic thermodynamic prediction, not a kinetic or metastable statement. The criterion is: CALPHAD equilibrium calculation at 750 K, 30 at.% Fe must yield Al13Fe4 + A2(Al-rich bcc) as the stable two-phase field, with both phases present in non-trace amounts.\n</VerbMapping>\n\n<MetricIntegrity>\nThe FoM is the **equilibrium phase assemblage** (which phases are present and stable). CALPHAD directly computes this via Gibbs energy minimization. No proxy is needed; the tool produces the exact FoM. I will verify:\n1. Number of phases = 2\n2. Identity of phases = Al13Fe4 and A2 (bcc, Al-rich)\n3. Non-negligible fractions of each phase\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\nCALPHAD is the standard method for equilibrium phase diagram calculations in the Fe-Al system. The tool must:\n- Represent the Fe-Al binary system\n- Include the Al13Fe4 intermetallic phase in its database\n- Include the A2 (bcc) solid solution phase\n- Be valid at 750 K and 30 at.% Fe\n\nI will check representation explicitly when calling the tool. If the database lacks Al13Fe4 or does not cover this composition/temperature range, I must return **Not Represented**.\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n- Composition: 30 at.% Fe = 0.30 mole fraction Fe, 0.70 mole fraction Al\n- Temperature: 750 K (no conversion needed; CALPHAD uses K)\n- Pressure: assumed 1 atm (standard for condensed-phase diagrams)\n- Phase fractions: will be reported in mole fraction or mass fraction by CALPHAD\n\n**Baseline validation**: The Fe-Al system is well-studied. At room temperature, Al13Fe4 is a known stable phase. At higher Al content (~70 at.% Al, 30 at.% Fe), we are near the Al-rich side. I expect either:\n- Al13Fe4 + fcc-Al (if below the bcc solvus), or\n- Al13Fe4 + bcc-Al (A2) (if within the bcc stability region)\n\nAt 750 K \u2248 477\u00b0C, this is a moderate temperature. The claim states \"Al-rich BCC Fe,\" which is unusual phrasing (typically we'd say \"Al-rich bcc solid solution\" or A2 phase). I will verify the phase identity carefully.\n\n**Known checkpoint**: The Al-Fe phase diagram shows Al13Fe4 is stable over a range of compositions. At 30 at.% Fe (= 70 at.% Al), we are close to the stoichiometry of Al13Fe4 (which is ~23.5 at.% Fe). A two-phase region Al13Fe4 + (Al-rich phase) is plausible.\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n**Test set**:\n1. Single CALPHAD equilibrium calculation at T = 750 K, x_Fe = 0.30 (30 at.% Fe)\n2. Extract: number of phases, phase names, phase fractions\n3. Verify: exactly 2 phases, one is Al13Fe4, the other is A2 (bcc), both with fractions \u22651%\n\n**Stop rule**:\n- If the calculation yields exactly Al13Fe4 + A2 (bcc, Al-rich) with non-trace fractions \u2192 **Supported**\n- If the calculation yields a different phase assemblage (e.g., Al13Fe4 + fcc-Al, or single-phase, or three phases) \u2192 **Refuted**\n- If the database does not represent Al13Fe4 or the composition/temperature range \u2192 **Not Represented**\n\n**Sensitivity check** (if needed): If the result is borderline (e.g., a phase has ~0.5% fraction), I may check T = 745 K and T = 755 K to see if the two-phase field is stable or a knife-edge. However, the claim is deterministic at 750 K, so the primary test is at exactly 750 K.\n\n**No replicates needed**: CALPHAD is deterministic for a given database.\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n---\n\n## Tool Plan\n\n<ToolPlan>\n**Primary tool**: CALPHAD (cost 5, 1 call allowed)\n- **Rationale**: The claim is a pure thermodynamic equilibrium statement. CALPHAD is the gold standard for such predictions.\n- **Input**: T = 750 K, composition = 30 at.% Fe, 70 at.% Al\n- **Expected output**: Phase assemblage (names, fractions)\n- **Decision**: If output matches claim \u2192 Supported. If not \u2192 Refuted (assuming representation is adequate).\n\n**Secondary tool**: search_tool (cost 3, up to 3 calls)\n- **Use case 1** (if needed): If CALPHAD result is ambiguous or contradicts the claim, search for experimental Fe-Al phase diagram data at 750 K, 30 at.% Fe to cross-check.\n- **Use case 2** (if needed): If phase nomenclature is unclear (e.g., \"Al-rich BCC Fe\" vs A2 vs B2), search for standard Fe-Al phase naming conventions.\n- **Constraint**: Only call if CALPHAD alone is insufficient. Prefer to resolve with CALPHAD first.\n\n**Not needed**: chgnet_mlip (kinetics/barriers are irrelevant for equilibrium phase assemblage).\n\n**Sequencing**:\n1. Call CALPHAD at 750 K, 30 at.% Fe\n2. Analyze output: check phase count, names, fractions\n3. If result is clear and matches/contradicts claim \u2192 finish\n4. If result is unclear or database representation is questionable \u2192 call search_tool for cross-validation (1 query: \"Fe-Al phase diagram 750 K 30 at.% Fe experimental\")\n5. Synthesize and score\n\n**Expected outcome**: CALPHAD should provide a definitive answer in one call. Search is a backup.\n</ToolPlan>\n\n---\n\n## Execution Plan\n\nI will now call the CALPHAD tool with the claim's exact conditions. The question I will pass to the tool is a precise restatement of the claim, asking it to verify the phase assemblage.",

    "thought_1": "## Analysis of CALPHAD Result\n\nThe CALPHAD tool has returned a definitive answer using the COST507 light-alloys database. Let me analyze this result against the claim:\n\n**CALPHAD Output:**\n- Stable phases at 750 K, 30 at.% Fe (70 at.% Al): **AL5FE2** and **AL2FE**\n- Phase fractions: AL5FE2 = 0.700 (70 mol%), AL2FE = 0.300 (30 mol%)\n- Explicit statement: \"The claim of a two-phase mixture of Al13Fe4 and Al-rich BCC (A2) is not supported; neither AL13FE4 nor BCC_A2 is stable at 750 K and 30 at.% Fe.\"\n\n**Claim stated:**\n- Two-phase mixture of **Al13Fe4** and **Al-rich BCC Fe (A2)**\n\n**Direct comparison:**\n1. **Number of phases**: Claim says 2, CALPHAD says 2 \u2713 (this matches)\n2. **Phase identities**: \n   - Claim: Al13Fe4 + A2 (bcc)\n   - CALPHAD: AL5FE2 + AL2FE\n   - **Mismatch**: Neither Al13Fe4 nor A2 (bcc) is present\n\n**Phase nomenclature check:**\n- AL5FE2 corresponds to Al5Fe2 (71.4 at.% Al, 28.6 at.% Fe)\n- AL2FE corresponds to Al2Fe (66.7 at.% Al, 33.3 at.% Fe)  \n- AL13FE4 would correspond to Al13Fe4 (76.5 at.% Al, 23.5 at.% Fe)\n- These are distinct intermetallic compounds with different stoichiometries and crystal structures\n\n**Interpretation:**\nThe CALPHAD calculation clearly shows that at 750 K and 30 at.% Fe:\n- The equilibrium phases are AL5FE2 and AL2FE (both intermetallic compounds)\n- Neither Al13Fe4 nor the A2 (bcc) solid solution phase is thermodynamically stable\n- The claim is **refuted** by this calculation\n\n**Representation check:**\nThe COST507 database is a well-established light-alloys database that includes Fe-Al intermetallics. The calculation successfully returned phases, indicating the system is represented. The absence of Al13Fe4 and A2 in the output is not a representation failure\u2014it means these phases are not stable at these conditions according to this database.\n\n**Database sensitivity consideration:**\nDifferent thermodynamic databases can give different predictions, especially for complex intermetallic systems. However:\n1. The tool explicitly checked for Al13Fe4 and A2 and found them unstable\n2. The returned phases (AL5FE2, AL2FE) are well-known Fe-Al intermetallics\n3. The composition (30 at.% Fe) is in the intermetallic-rich region, not the terminal solid solution region where A2 would be expected\n\n**Decision:**\nThe CALPHAD result provides a clear, definitive answer that contradicts the claim. The claim states Al13Fe4 + A2 (bcc), but the calculation shows AL5FE2 + AL2FE. This is a direct refutation.\n\n**Should I call search_tool for cross-validation?**\n\nGiven the tool policy:\n- \"If either calphad or chgnet_mlip yields a conclusive answer, treat it as final. Do not call further tools unnecessarily.\"\n- \"Once you have enough evidence to infer feasibility, STOP. Do not call more tools just to be 'conclusive,' 'exhaustive,' or 'definitive.'\"\n\nThe CALPHAD result is conclusive: it explicitly states the claim is not supported and provides the actual stable phases. The result is unambiguous\u2014wrong phases are predicted by the claim.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether this might be a database-specific result. The guideline states: \"If a boundary is truly database-sensitive, a second TDB inside the CALPHAD lane is permissible to resolve representation/sensitivity.\"\n\nBut the issue here is not a boundary sensitivity (e.g., a phase fraction near zero or a temperature near a phase transition). The claim predicts entirely different phases (Al13Fe4 and A2) than what CALPHAD finds (AL5FE2 and AL2FE). This is a fundamental disagreement, not a marginal one.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe CALPHAD result is decisive and conclusive. The claim is **refuted**. I should proceed to finish and provide the structured report.\n\n**Stop rule satisfied:** The universal claim has been contradicted by a well-matched computational result.

  "reasoning": "The claim verification proceeded through the mandatory pre-flight analysis followed by a single CALPHAD calculation, which provided a definitive answer.\n\n## Pre-Flight Analysis Summary\n\nThe claim was locked into a Claim Card identifying:\n- **System**: Fe-Al binary alloy at 30 at.% Fe, 70 at.% Al\n- **Conditions**: 750 K, ambient pressure, equilibrium\n- **Observable**: Equilibrium phase assemblage (specifically two phases: Al13Fe4 and Al-rich BCC Fe)\n- **Quantifier**: Universal/deterministic (\"results thermodynamically in\")\n- **Threshold**: Exact phase match with non-negligible fractions (\u22651%)\n\nThe metric integrity was confirmed\u2014CALPHAD directly computes equilibrium phase assemblages via Gibbs energy minimization, providing the exact FoM without proxies. The representation gate was satisfied as CALPHAD is the standard tool for Fe-Al phase equilibria.\n\n## CALPHAD Evaluation\n\nA single equilibrium calculation at 750 K, 30 at.% Fe using the COST507 light-alloys database yielded:\n- **Stable phases**: AL5FE2 (Al5Fe2) and AL2FE (Al2Fe)\n- **Phase fractions**: AL5FE2 = 70 mol%, AL2FE = 30 mol%\n- **Explicit finding**: Neither Al13Fe4 nor BCC_A2 (Al-rich bcc) is stable at these conditions\n\n## Evidence Analysis\n\n**Direct comparison with claim**:\n1. **Phase count**: Both claim and calculation predict 2 phases \u2713\n2. **Phase identities**: \n   - Claimed: Al13Fe4 + A2 (bcc solid solution)\n   - Calculated: Al5Fe2 + Al2Fe (both intermetallics)\n   - **Complete mismatch** in phase identities\n\n**Phase nomenclature verification**:\n- Al5Fe2 (71.4 at.% Al) and Al2Fe (66.7 at.% Al) are distinct intermetallic compounds\n- Al13Fe4 (76.5 at.% Al) is a different intermetallic with different stoichiometry and structure\n- A2 (bcc) is a disordered solid solution phase, not an intermetallic\n- These are fundamentally different phases, not nomenclature variants\n\n**Representation confirmation**:\nThe COST507 database successfully computed equilibrium phases in the Fe-Al system at the specified conditions. The absence of Al13Fe4 and A2 in the output indicates these phases are thermodynamically unstable at 750 K and 30 at.% Fe according to this database, not that they are unrepresented.\n\n## Synthesis\n\nThe CALPHAD calculation provides a clear, unambiguous refutation of the claim. The predicted phase assemblage (Al5Fe2 + Al2Fe) is entirely different from the claimed assemblage (Al13Fe4 + Al-rich BCC). This is not a marginal disagreement (e.g., slightly different phase fractions or a boundary sensitivity) but a fundamental mismatch in which phases are thermodynamically stable.\n\nAt 30 at.% Fe and 750 K, the system lies in an intermetallic-dominated region of the Fe-Al phase diagram. The calculation shows two intermetallic phases (Al5Fe2 and Al2Fe) are stable, consistent with this being in the intermetallic-rich portion of the diagram. The claim's prediction of a bcc solid solution phase (A2) at this composition is inconsistent with the intermetallic-dominated nature of this region.\n\n## Score: Refuted\n\n**Rationale**: The CALPHAD equilibrium calculation at the exact claimed conditions (750 K, 30 at.% Fe) predicts a two-phase mixture of Al5Fe2 + Al2Fe, not the claimed Al13Fe4 + Al-rich BCC. Neither of the claimed phases is present in the calculated equilibrium assemblage. This constitutes a direct thermodynamic refutation of the claim using the standard computational method for phase equilibria. The disagreement is fundamental (wrong phases entirely), not marginal, and the calculation is within the tool's representation scope.\n\n## Sanity Checks\n\n\u2713 **Units**: Composition in at.%, temperature in K\u2014consistent throughout\n\u2713 **Metric match**: Evaluated equilibrium phase assemblage, which is exactly the claim's FoM\n\u2713 **Scope fidelity**: Calculation at exact claimed conditions (750 K, 30 at.% Fe)\n\u2713 **Tool representation**: COST507 database covers Fe-Al system and returned valid phases\n\u2713 **Score-narrative agreement**: Score of \"Refuted\" matches the finding that predicted phases do not match claimed phases\n\n## What Would Change the Score\n\n1. **Alternative database validation**: If a different, equally authoritative thermodynamic database (e.g., TCAL, SSOL) predicted Al13Fe4 + A2 at these conditions, it would indicate database sensitivity and warrant downgrading to \"Conditional/Database-dependent\"\n\n2. **Experimental phase diagram data**: Direct experimental measurements of phase assemblage at 750 K, 30 at.% Fe showing Al13Fe4 + bcc would override the computational prediction\n\n3. **Metastability clarification**: If the claim intended to describe a metastable (not equilibrium) state, the evaluation framework would change entirely, though the claim explicitly states \"thermodynamically\"",
  "answer": "**Verdict: REFUTED**\n\nThe claim that a mixture of 30 at.% Fe and 70 at.% Al at 750 K results thermodynamically in a two-phase solid mixture of Al13Fe4 and Al-rich BCC Fe is **refuted** by CALPHAD equilibrium calculations.\n\n**Key Findings**:\n- CALPHAD calculation (COST507 database) at 750 K, 30 at.% Fe predicts: **Al5Fe2 (70 mol%) + Al2Fe (30 mol%)**\n- Neither Al13Fe4 nor BCC_A2 (Al-rich bcc) is thermodynamically stable at these conditions\n- The predicted phases are entirely different intermetallic compounds than those claimed\n\n**Evidence Quality**: The CALPHAD method is the gold standard for equilibrium phase diagram predictions. The calculation was performed at the exact claimed conditions with a well-established light-alloys database. The result is unambiguous\u2014the claimed phases are not present in the equilibrium assemblage.\n\n**Confidence**: High. The disagreement is fundamental (completely different phases), not marginal. The composition (30 at.% Fe) places the system in an intermetallic-rich region where multiple Fe-Al intermetallics compete, and the calculation identifies Al5Fe2 and Al2Fe as the stable pair, not Al13Fe4 and bcc solid solution."
