  "reasoning": "-2 (Infeasible) because direct, condition-matched CALPHAD thermodynamics at 750 K and 30 at.% Fe yields an entirely different two-phase equilibrium (Al5Fe2 + Al2Fe), and the Fe\u2013Al phase diagram places 70 at.% Al firmly in the intermetallic region, not involving an Al-rich bcc solid solution or Al13Fe4 at this composition.\n\nClaim decomposition (minima that must hold):\n- Composition/conditions: Fe\u2013Al at 30 at.% Fe, 750 K, ambient pressure, equilibrium.\n- Phases: Al13Fe4 must be stable at this composition/temperature; an Al-rich bcc (A2) solid solution must be stable; these two must coexist as the equilibrium two-phase assemblage.\n\nEvidence:\n- Direct (matching conditions): CALPHAD (COST507) at 750 K, 30 at.% Fe \u2192 Al5Fe2 (\u224870 mol%) + Al2Fe (\u224830 mol%); neither Al13Fe4 nor bcc_A2 present.\n- Authoritative thermodynamic context: Established Fe\u2013Al diagrams place 70 at.% Al in the two-phase intermetallic field (near Al2Fe and Fe2Al5); bcc_A2 is not stable at this Al-rich composition at 750 K; Al13Fe4 stabilizes nearer \u224876\u201377 at.% Al, not at 70 at.% Al.\n- Contradictions: Complete mismatch in phase identities; claimed phases are thermodynamically unstable at the stated point per CALPHAD.\n\nWhy not other scores:\n- \u20131: Not a minor range/quantity issue; phases are fundamentally wrong at the stated composition/temperature.\n- 0: Evidence is aligned and decisive (exact-condition CALPHAD + known diagram context).\n- +1/+2: No supporting elements for the claimed assemblage.\n\nAssumptions/limits:\n- Equilibrium (not metastable) interpretation; ambient pressure; database (COST507) represents Fe\u2013Al reliably. Alternate databases or direct experiments at the same conditions could be checked but would need to overturn both CALPHAD and established diagram trends.",
