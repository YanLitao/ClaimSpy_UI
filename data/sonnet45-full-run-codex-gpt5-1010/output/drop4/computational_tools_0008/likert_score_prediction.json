  "reasoning": "-1 (Partially Infeasible) because condition-matched CALPHAD results show that Cu80Li10Al10 does not form a single thermodynamically stable phase at 298 K, 1 atm; it equilibrates as a two-phase mixture (FCC_A1 ~90% + BCC_B2 ~10%). Under the assessment\u2019s interpretation that \u201cthermodynamically stable anode\u201d implies single-phase thermodynamic stability at the stated composition and conditions, a necessary element fails.\n\nMinima that must hold (as interpreted in the assessment):\n- Single-phase thermodynamic stability at Cu80Li10Al10 under ambient conditions.\n- Correct system/conditions (298 K, 1 atm).\n- Compatibility of the stability method with the claim.\n\nEvidence mapping:\n- Direct (CALPHAD, COST 507 TDB, 298 K, 1 atm): two-phase equilibrium FCC_A1 + BCC_B2 \u2192 contradicts single-phase stability.\n\nWhy not \u20132:\n- The contradiction is parametric/practical (single-phase vs two-phase) rather than fundamental impossibility of forming a thermodynamically stable material at this composition; the alloy is thermodynamically stable as a mixture. Narrowing the claim (allowing multiphase) would remove the conflict.\n\nWhy not 0 or +1/+2:\n- 0 would require balanced/insufficient evidence; here there is direct, condition-matched contrary evidence to single-phase stability.\n- +1/+2 would require evidence that the specified composition is single-phase stable or otherwise aligned with the stated stability criterion, which is absent.\n\nAssumptions/limitations:\n- Interprets \u201cthermodynamically stable anode\u201d as requiring single-phase stability at 298 K; electrochemical performance and stability in electrolyte are out of scope for this judgment.",
