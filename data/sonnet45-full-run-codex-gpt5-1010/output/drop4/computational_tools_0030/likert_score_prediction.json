  "reasoning": "0 (Cannot determine) because the claim is a comparative ranking of saturation magnetization degradation across Ni-, Co-, and Nd-doped hematite without specifying critical conditions (dopant concentration, synthesis/phase purity, measurement protocol), and no condition-matched evidence was retrieved. The minima that must hold are: (1) single-phase doped hematite for all three dopants under comparable conditions; (2) Ms measured consistently showing Co causes the smallest reduction vs undoped, with differences exceeding measurement uncertainty; (3) matched dopant levels and microstructures to avoid grain-size/secondary-phase confounds. Available tools returned no on-system data, and proxy modeling is not appropriate for Ms. Known behavior of \u03b1-Fe2O3 indicates Ms is highly sensitive to dopant valence/site, oxygen vacancies, Morin transition shifts, grain size, and secondary phases, so the ranking can invert with conditions. Without matched-condition data, feasibility as stated cannot be adjudicated.\n\nWhy not \u20131/+1: No directional, condition-matched evidence to lean against/for the ranking; broad claim scope likely condition-dependent. Why not +2: No direct verification.\n\nAssumptions/limits: Ambient conditions assumed; dilute-substitution regime and single-phase control not established.",
