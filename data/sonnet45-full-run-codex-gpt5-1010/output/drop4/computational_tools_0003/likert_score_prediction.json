  "reasoning": "\u20132 (Infeasible) because authoritative thermodynamics for equiatomic Al\u2013Zn show a broad two\u2011phase field (FCC_A1 + HCP_ZN) at ambient pressure across most of T < 700 K, with single\u2011phase FCC_A1 only near ~650\u2013700 K; the claim requires single\u2011phase at all T < 700 K and is directly contradicted.\n\n- Minima that must hold:\n  1) At 50 at.% Al\u2013Zn, ambient pressure, the alloy is a single solid phase at every temperature below 700 K.\n  2) No secondary phase exceeds a small fraction across the entire range.\n\n- Evidence mapping:\n  - Direct (matching conditions): CALPHAD (COST 507) at xAl = xZn = 0.5, 1 atm shows FCC_A1 + HCP_ZN with roughly equal fractions at 300 K and 500 K; only near 650 K does single\u2011phase FCC_A1 appear. This aligns with known Al\u2013Zn phase diagrams (limited mutual solubility and two\u2011phase region at lower T).\n  - Contradictions: The presence of substantial two\u2011phase equilibria at 300 K and 500 K refutes the universal \u201c<700 K\u201d single\u2011phase assertion.\n\n- Why not \u20131: The failure is not a minor range/number mismatch; the universal claim is fundamentally incompatible with the equilibrium phase diagram over a large portion of the stated range.\n- Why not 0: Conditions and evidence are well aligned; contradiction is direct.\n- Why not +1/+2: The required single\u2011phase condition does not hold over most of the range, so positive feasibility is unsupported.\n\nAssumptions/limitations: Equilibrium interpretation at ambient pressure; composition fixed at 50\u201350; metastable supersaturation by quenching is not claimed and would not satisfy an unconditional, all\u2011T statement.",
