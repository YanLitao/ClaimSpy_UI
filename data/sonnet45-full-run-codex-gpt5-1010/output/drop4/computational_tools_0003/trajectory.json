Any two-phase region with >5% of a second phase refutes the claim.\n</ClaimCard>\n\n<VerbMapping>\n- \"forms a single solid phase\" \u2192 exactly one solid phase present with \u226595% phase fraction\n- This is a **universal** claim: at ALL temperatures below 700 K and at the 50-50 composition, only one solid phase should be stable\n- The weakest refutation: finding ANY temperature below 700 K where two or more phases coexist with >5% each\n</VerbMapping>\n\n<MetricIntegrity>\nThe FoM is **phase count** and **phase fraction** at the specified composition and temperature range. CALPHAD directly computes equilibrium phase assemblages and fractions, making it the exact tool for this metric. No proxy is needed.\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\nCALPHAD databases typically include Al-Zn binary systems, as both are common engineering metals. The Al-Zn system is well-studied with known phases including:\n- FCC (Al-rich terminal solid solution)\n- HCP (Zn-rich terminal solid solution)  \n- Possible intermediate phases\n\nThe tool should represent this system adequately. I will verify representation during the call.\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n- Temperature: 700 K = 427\u00b0C (well within typical CALPHAD range)\n- Composition: 50 at.% Al, 50 at.% Zn (mole fraction x_Al = 0.5)\n- Phase fraction: dimensionless (0 to 1, or 0% to 100%)\n\nBaseline check: The Al-Zn phase diagram is well-established. At room temperature (~300 K), Al and Zn have limited mutual solubility, forming FCC (Al-rich) and HCP (Zn-rich) phases. At 50-50 composition and low temperatures, I expect a two-phase region (FCC + HCP). At higher temperatures, there may be a single-phase region. The claim states T < 700 K, which spans a wide range including both low and intermediate temperatures.\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\nSince this is a **universal** claim over a temperature range, I need to:\n1. Evaluate phase equilibria at Al\u2085\u2080Zn\u2085\u2080 across the temperature range 0-700 K\n2. Check for any temperature where multiple phases coexist\n3. A single counterexample (two-phase region) refutes the universal claim\n\nStop rule: If I find ANY temperature below 700 K where two or more solid phases coexist with significant fractions (>5% each), the claim is refuted. I can stop immediately.\n\nTest points: Sample the range 0-700 K, including:\n- Low T (~300 K, room temperature)\n- Mid T (~500 K)\n- High T (~650 K, near the upper bound)\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n<ToolPlan>\n**Primary tool: CALPHAD** (cost 5, 1 call allowed)\n\nRationale:\n- The claim is about **phase stability** and **phase count** at equilibrium\n- CALPHAD directly computes equilibrium phase assemblages and fractions vs. T and composition\n- This is the ideal tool for thermodynamic phase presence questions\n- One call can evaluate the entire T range (0-700 K) at x_Al = 0.5\n\n**Search tool** (cost 3, up to 3 calls): \n- May use 1 query if CALPHAD result is inconclusive or to verify known Al-Zn phase diagram features\n- Will NOT use for discovery/news queries\n- Will use only for technical priors (e.g., \"Al-Zn phase diagram 50 at.% temperature range\")\n\n**CHGNet**: Not applicable - this is a thermodynamic equilibrium question, not a kinetics/barrier question\n\n**Sequence:**\n1. Call CALPHAD with the question about phase stability at Al\u2085\u2080Zn\u2085\u2080 below 700 K\n2. Analyze phase fractions across the temperature range\n3. If two-phase region found \u2192 claim refuted \u2192 STOP\n4. If single-phase throughout \u2192 may verify with search for independent confirmation\n5. Synthesize and score\n\nThis is optimal because:\n- One CALPHAD call can decisively answer the question\n- Universal claims need only one counterexample to refute\n- If refuted, no additional tools needed\n- If supported, one search query can provide independent verification within budget\n</ToolPlan>\n\nNow I will call CALPHAD to evaluate the phase equilibria at Al\u2085\u2080Zn\u2085\u2080 from 0 to 700 K.",

    "thought_1": "Excellent! The CALPHAD result provides decisive evidence. Let me analyze this carefully:\n\n## Evidence Analysis\n\n**CALPHAD Output Summary:**\n- Database: COST 507 (standard Al-Zn database)\n- Phases considered: LIQUID, FCC_A1, HCP_A3, HCP_ZN, BCC_A2\n- Composition: X(Al) = 0.50 (exactly as claimed)\n- Temperature range: 1-700 K (effectively 0-700 K)\n\n**Key Finding:**\nThe alloy is **NOT single-phase** over the entire 0-700 K range.\n\n**Phase Assemblages:**\n- **300 K:** FCC_A1 (50.3%) + HCP_ZN (49.7%) \u2192 **TWO-PHASE**\n- **500 K:** FCC_A1 (53.8%) + HCP_ZN (46.2%) \u2192 **TWO-PHASE**  \n- **650 K:** FCC_A1 (100.0%) \u2192 **SINGLE-PHASE**\n\n**Critical Observation:**\nAt temperatures below ~650 K, the alloy exists as a two-phase mixture of FCC_A1 (Al-rich) and HCP_ZN (Zn-rich) with substantial fractions of each phase (~50% each). Only at temperatures \u2265650 K does the alloy become single-phase FCC_A1.\n\n## Claim Evaluation\n\n**Claim:** \"Al50Zn50 forms a single solid phase <700K\"\n\n**Interpretation:** This is a **universal claim** stating that at ALL temperatures below 700 K, the alloy forms a single solid phase.\n\n**Evidence:** \n- At 300 K: Two phases present (FCC_A1 + HCP_ZN), each ~50%\n- At 500 K: Two phases present (FCC_A1 + HCP_ZN), each ~45-54%\n- At 650 K: Single phase (FCC_A1) at 100%\n\n**Threshold Check:**\nUsing the standard metallurgical criterion of \u226595% for single-phase material:\n- At 300 K and 500 K, neither phase exceeds 95% \u2192 **NOT single-phase**\n- Both phases are present at >5% \u2192 **Clearly two-phase region**\n\n**Decisive Counterexample:**\nThe existence of a two-phase region (FCC_A1 + HCP_ZN) at temperatures from ~1 K to ~600-650 K **directly refutes** the universal claim. The claim states the alloy forms a single phase at ALL temperatures below 700 K, but we have found multiple temperatures (300 K, 500 K, and the entire low-to-mid temperature range) where two phases coexist.\n\n## Stop Rule Triggered\n\nPer the guidelines:\n- **Universal claims:** one well-matched counterexample suffices \u2192 STOP\n- We have found clear counterexamples at 300 K and 500 K\n- No additional tools are needed\n\nThe claim is **REFUTED** by first-principles thermodynamic calculations.\n\n## Synthesis and Scoring\n\n**Evidence Table:**\n\n| Temperature | Setup | Phase Assemblage | FCC_A1 Fraction | HCP_ZN Fraction | Single-Phase? | In-Scope |\n|-------------|-------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|----------|\n| 300 K | Al\u2085\u2080Zn\u2085\u2080, 1 atm | FCC_A1 + HCP_ZN | 0.503 | 0.497 | NO | YES |\n| 500 K | Al\u2085\u2080Zn\u2085\u2080, 1 atm | FCC_A1 + HCP_ZN | 0.538 | 0.462 | NO | YES |\n| 650 K | Al\u2085\u2080Zn\u2085\u2080, 1 atm | FCC_A1 | 1.000 | 0.000 | YES | YES |\n\n**Direction and Magnitude:**\n- The claim asserts single-phase behavior throughout T < 700 K\n- Evidence shows two-phase behavior from ~1 K to ~600-650 K\n- Single-phase behavior only emerges at T \u2265 ~650 K\n- The claim is contradicted across ~90% of the stated temperature range\n\n**Score: INFEASIBLE**\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe claim is a universal statement that Al\u2085\u2080Zn\u2085\u2080 forms a single solid phase at all temperatures below 700 K. CALPHAD calculations using the COST 507 database show that at 50 at.% Al and temperatures from 1 K to approximately 600-650 K, the equilibrium state consists of two solid phases (FCC_A1 and HCP_ZN) with comparable fractions (~50% each at low temperatures). This two-phase region spans the majority of the claimed temperature range. Only at temperatures above ~650 K (but still below 700 K) does the alloy become single-phase FCC_A1. The existence of a substantial two-phase region below 700 K directly contradicts the universal claim. The evidence is clear, in-scope, and decisive.\n\n**Sanity Checks:**\n\u2713 Units: Temperature in K, phase fractions dimensionless (0-1)\n\u2713 Baseline: Al-Zn system is well-known to have limited mutual solubility at low T, forming FCC (Al-rich) + HCP (Zn-rich) two-phase regions at intermediate compositions - consistent with results\n\u2713 Metric: Phase count and fractions directly measured, no proxy used\n\u2713 Scope: Exact composition (50-50) and temperature range (0-700 K) as claimed\n\u2713 Score-narrative agreement: INFEASIBLE verdict matches the finding of a two-phase region contradicting the universal claim\n\n**What would change the score:**\n- Experimental phase diagram data at 50 at.% Al showing single-phase behavior throughout 0-700 K would contradict the CALPHAD result\n- Alternative thermodynamic database showing different phase stability\n- However, the COST 507 database is well-validated for Al-Zn, and the two-phase region at intermediate compositions and low temperatures is well-established in the literature\n\nSince I have obtained decisive evidence that refutes the claim, and per the stop rules for universal claims (one counterexample suffices), I will now finish the task.",
