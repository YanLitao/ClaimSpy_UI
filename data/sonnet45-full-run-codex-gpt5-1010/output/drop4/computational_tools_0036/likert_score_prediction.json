  "reasoning": "+2 (Feasible) because both direct experimental reports and supportive computations agree that, in dilute substitutional solid solution within fcc Al, Mg expands the lattice while Cu and Zn do not increase it (Cu contracts; Zn contracts or is near\u2011zero), making Mg the largest increaser as claimed.\n\n- Minima to satisfy:\n  1) Cu, Mg, and Zn occupy substitutional sites in fcc Al in the dilute limit.\n  2) The equilibrium lattice parameter change can be ranked across these solutes under comparable conditions.\n  3) Mg must yield the largest positive \u0394a among the three.\n\n- Evidence mapping:\n  \u2022 Direct/experimental: Classic XRD studies on Al solid solutions report Mg increases the Al lattice parameter, whereas Cu and Zn decrease it (condition-matched dilute fcc Al).  \n  \u2022 Computational (supportive): CHGNet supercell relaxations show Mg +0.040%, Cu \u22120.215%, Zn ~0.000%. Despite small Mg\u2013Zn separation within model uncertainty, the sign/trend aligns with experiments.  \n  \u2022 Contradictions: None cited; trend is consistent with atomic size arguments (Mg > Al radius; Cu, Zn \u2264 Al).\n\n- Why not other scores:\n  \u2022 Not \u22122/\u22121: No fundamental or quantitative contradictions; broad literature supports the trend.  \n  \u2022 Not 0: Evidence is aligned and sufficient to decide.  \n  \u2022 Not +1: We have direct, condition\u2011matched experimental precedent establishing the comparative ordering.\n\n- Assumptions/limits:\n  \u2022 Dilute substitutional regime in the primary fcc Al matrix; not addressing high concentrations, clustering, or precipitate-forming conditions.  \n  \u2022 Ambient/near\u2011ambient conditions typical for lattice parameter measurements.",
