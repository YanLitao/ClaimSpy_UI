  "reasoning": "- \u20132 (Infeasible) because condition-matched thermodynamics (CALPHAD with a validated Al\u2013Zn database) at Al20Zn80 and 870 K shows 100% liquid (0% solid), directly contradicting the claim that it \u201cis a solid\u201d at equilibrium.\n- Minima: (1) Al20Zn80 composition, (2) T = 870 K, (3) equilibrium, (4) solid phase present (near-100% solid fraction). Item (4) fails decisively.\n- Evidence: Direct CALPHAD result; consistent with phase diagram intuition\u2014870 K (~597\u00b0C) is far above Zn\u2019s melting point (~693 K, 420\u00b0C), so Zn\u2011rich alloys are liquid at this temperature.\n- Why not \u20131/0/+1/+2: Not \u20131 or 0 because the contradiction is fundamental and decisive; not positive because the required solid state is absent.\n- Assumptions: Composition interpreted as at%; Al\u2013Zn database reliability is high for this well\u2011studied binary.",
