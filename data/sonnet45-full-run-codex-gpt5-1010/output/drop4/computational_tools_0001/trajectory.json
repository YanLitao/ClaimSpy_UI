Given computational/database precision, we'll accept \u226599.5% solid fraction as meeting the threshold.\n</ClaimCard>\n\n<VerbMapping>\nThe verb \"is\" in \"is a solid\" maps to a definite state assertion. This is not \"can be\" (existential) but rather \"the equilibrium state is solid\" (universal at this specific point). The criterion is: at equilibrium at 870K and Al20Zn80 composition, the system must be entirely (or effectively entirely, \u226599.5%) in solid phase(s), with no liquid present.\n</VerbMapping>\n\n<MetricIntegrity>\nThe FoM is the phase state: solid vs liquid. CALPHAD directly computes phase fractions at equilibrium for given T and composition, making it the ideal tool. The output will be phase fractions (solid phases vs liquid). No proxy is needed; we can directly assess whether liquid is present or absent.\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\nCALPHAD with an appropriate Al-Zn thermodynamic database should represent this binary system well. Al-Zn is a well-studied binary system with established phase diagrams. The temperature 870K (\u2248597\u00b0C) is well within the range of typical phase diagram data. CALPHAD should be able to represent:\n- Solid solution phases (fcc, hcp)\n- Liquid phase\n- Any intermetallic compounds if present\nThis system and conditions are well within CALPHAD's scope.\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n- Temperature: 870 K (no conversion needed; CALPHAD typically uses K)\n- Composition: Al20Zn80 = 0.20 mole fraction Al, 0.80 mole fraction Zn\n- Output: phase fractions (dimensionless, 0-1 or 0-100%)\n\nBaseline check: The Al-Zn phase diagram is well-known. At room temperature, Zn-rich compositions are typically hcp (\u03b7 phase). At higher temperatures, there's a eutectic around 655K (~382\u00b0C) at approximately 95 at.% Zn. At 870K, we're well above typical melting points for Zn-rich regions. Pure Zn melts at 692.7K (419.5\u00b0C). The Al-Zn system has a eutectic, and at 80 at.% Zn (20 at.% Al), we need to check if 870K is above or below the liquidus.\n\nFrom known phase diagram features: the liquidus temperature at Al20Zn80 should be checked. This composition is in the Zn-rich region. Given that pure Zn melts at ~693K and the eutectic is around 655K at ~95% Zn, at 20% Al (80% Zn), the liquidus is likely higher than pure Zn but we need to verify.\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n**Test design:**\n1. Single CALPHAD calculation at exactly T=870K, composition Al20Zn80\n2. Extract phase fractions: specifically, check for presence/absence of liquid phase\n3. Stop rule: If liquid fraction = 0 (or <0.5%), claim is SUPPORTED. If liquid fraction > 0.5%, claim is REFUTED.\n\n**Replicates/sensitivity:** Given this is a deterministic thermodynamic calculation at a single point, no replicates are needed. However, a small temperature sweep (\u00b110K) could verify we're not at a knife-edge boundary, but this is secondary.\n\n**Independent verification:** A search for Al-Zn phase diagram data at this composition and temperature would provide independent corroboration.\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n<ToolPlan>\n**Primary tool: CALPHAD** (cost 5, 1 call)\n- Direct assessment of equilibrium phase state at Al20Zn80, 870K\n- Will provide definitive answer about solid vs liquid state\n- This is the most appropriate tool for this thermodynamic equilibrium question\n\n**Secondary tool: search_tool** (cost 3, 1 query if needed)\n- Only if CALPHAD result is ambiguous or needs corroboration\n- Search for \"Al-Zn phase diagram 870K\" or \"Al20Zn80 liquidus temperature\"\n- Would provide independent literature verification\n\n**Sequencing:**\n1. Call CALPHAD first - this directly answers the question\n2. If result is clear (liquid fraction = 0 or liquid fraction > 0), we have our answer and STOP\n3. Only if result is ambiguous (e.g., at phase boundary), consider search_tool for corroboration\n\n**Rationale:** This is a pure thermodynamic equilibrium question. CALPHAD is designed exactly for this. One call should be decisive. Search would be redundant unless CALPHAD fails or gives boundary-case results.\n</ToolPlan>\n\n## Decision\n\nI will call CALPHAD first with the question asking whether Al20Zn80 at 870K is solid at equilibrium. This single call should provide a definitive answer about the phase state.",

    "thought_1": "## Analysis of CALPHAD Result\n\nThe CALPHAD calculation provides a **definitive answer**:\n\n**Result:** At Al20Zn80 and 870K, the equilibrium state is **entirely liquid** (liquid phase fraction = 1.0000, no solid phases above 10\u207b\u00b3 threshold).\n\n**Interpretation:**\n- The claim states \"Al20Zn80 at 870K is a solid at equilibrium\"\n- CALPHAD shows liquid fraction = 100%, solid fraction = 0%\n- This **directly refutes** the claim\n\n**Evidence quality:**\n- CALPHAD is the gold-standard tool for equilibrium phase predictions\n- The COST 507 database is a well-validated database for Al alloys\n- The calculation is deterministic and unambiguous\n- Result is far from any threshold ambiguity (100% liquid vs 0% solid)\n\n**Stop rule triggered:** This is a universal claim (\"is a solid\") refuted by clear evidence (system is liquid). Per the guidelines:\n- \"Universal claims: one well-matched counterexample suffices \u2192 stop\"\n- \"If either calphad or chgnet_mlip yields a conclusive answer, treat it as final. Do not call further tools unnecessarily.\"\n\n**Cross-validation consideration:**\nWhile I could use search_tool to verify the Al-Zn phase diagram, this would be redundant because:\n1. The CALPHAD result is unambiguous (100% liquid)\n2. This is well within CALPHAD's validated domain (binary Al-Zn system)\n3. The result makes physical sense: 870K (597\u00b0C) is above the melting point for this Zn-rich composition\n4. Additional tools would not change a clear refutation\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is **REFUTED**. Al20Zn80 at 870K is liquid, not solid, at equilibrium.\n\n## Final Report\n\n### 1. Claim (verbatim)\n\"Al20Zn80 at 870K is a solid at equilibrium\"\n\n### 2. Scope Lock\n- **System:** Al-Zn binary alloy\n- **Composition:** Al20Zn80 (20 at.% Al, 80 at.% Zn)\n- **Temperature:** 870 K (597\u00b0C)\n- **Pressure:** Ambient (1 atm, assumed)\n- **Measurement context:** Equilibrium phase state\n- **Constraints:** None\n\n### 3. Evaluation Type\nUniversal/definite assertion at a specific point (T, composition)\n\n### 4. Target FoM & Units\nPhase state: solid vs liquid. Quantified as phase fractions (dimensionless, 0-1). Threshold: \u226599.5% solid required to support \"is a solid.\"\n\n### 5. Plan\nSingle CALPHAD equilibrium calculation at Al20Zn80, 870K to determine phase fractions.\n\n### 6. Evidence Table\n\n| Setup | Tool | Raw Output | FoM | Uncertainty | In-scope |\n|-------|------|------------|-----|-------------|----------|\n| Al20Zn80, 870K, equilibrium | CALPHAD (COST507 DB) | Liquid fraction = 1.0000, no solid phases >10\u207b\u00b3 | 0% solid, 100% liquid | \u00b1negligible (deterministic) | \u2713 Yes |\n\n### 7. Synthesis\nThe CALPHAD calculation unambiguously shows that Al20Zn80 at 870K is entirely liquid at equilibrium. The liquid phase fraction is 1.0000 (100%), with no solid phases detected above the 10\u207b\u00b3 threshold. This directly contradicts the claim that the system \"is a solid.\" The result is physically consistent: 870K is above the liquidus temperature for this Zn-rich composition in the Al-Zn system.\n\n### 8. Score & Rationale\n**Score: REFUTED (Definitely False)**\n\nThe claim asserts the system is solid, but CALPHAD shows it is 100% liquid. The evidence is unambiguous, from a validated tool and database, at exactly the claimed conditions. The threshold for \"is a solid\" (\u226599.5% solid) is not met; instead, we have 0% solid. This is a clear, definitive refutation.\n\n### 9. Sanity/Consistency Checks\n- \u2713 Units: Temperature in K, composition in mole fraction, phase fractions dimensionless\n- \u2713 Baseline: Al-Zn is well-studied; pure Zn melts at 693K, so 870K being above liquidus for Al20Zn80 is reasonable\n- \u2713 Tool representation: CALPHAD with COST507 database covers Al-Zn binary system\n- \u2713 Metric match: Evaluated phase state (solid vs liquid) matches claim's FoM\n- \u2713 Score-narrative agreement: \"REFUTED\" matches \"100% liquid, 0% solid\"\n\n### 10. What Would Change the Score\n- Experimental measurement at exactly Al20Zn80, 870K showing solid phases present\n- Alternative thermodynamic database giving different phase equilibria (unlikely for this well-studied system)\n- Discovery of metastable solid phases (but claim specifies \"equilibrium\")\n\nThe evidence is decisive; no further tool calls are warranted.",

  "reasoning": "The claim verification followed the structured guideline protocol:\n\n**Pre-Flight Analysis:**\nI established a clear Claim Card identifying the system (Al-Zn binary at Al20Zn80), conditions (870K, equilibrium), and the figure of merit (phase state: solid vs liquid). The threshold was set at \u226599.5% solid fraction to satisfy \"is a solid.\" The verb \"is\" was correctly mapped as a universal/definite assertion requiring the equilibrium state to be entirely solid.\n\n**Tool Selection:**\nCALPHAD was identified as the optimal tool because:\n1. It directly computes equilibrium phase fractions for the exact FoM needed\n2. The Al-Zn binary system is well-represented in thermodynamic databases\n3. One calculation provides a definitive answer for this thermodynamic equilibrium question\n4. Cost-effective (single call, cost 5) compared to redundant searches\n\n**Execution:**\nThe CALPHAD calculation using the COST 507 database returned an unambiguous result: liquid phase fraction = 1.0000 (100%), with no solid phases above the 10\u207b\u00b3 detection threshold at Al20Zn80 and 870K.\n\n**Evidence Quality:**\n- Direct measurement of the target FoM (phase state)\n- Well-validated tool and database for this system\n- Result is deterministic and far from any ambiguity threshold\n- Physically consistent (870K is above typical liquidus for Zn-rich compositions)\n\n**Stop Rule Application:**\nPer the guidelines, \"Universal claims: one well-matched counterexample suffices \u2192 stop.\" The claim asserts the system \"is a solid,\" but CALPHAD shows it is 100% liquid. This is a clear refutation that meets the stop criterion. Additional tool calls would be redundant and violate the principle of not stacking tools unnecessarily.\n\n**Verification:**\nThe claim threshold required \u226599.5% solid. The actual result was 0% solid, 100% liquid. This definitively refutes the claim with no ambiguity.",
  "answer": "**REFUTED (Definitely False)**\n\nThe claim that \"Al20Zn80 at 870K is a solid at equilibrium\" is definitively refuted by CALPHAD thermodynamic calculations. \n\n**Key Finding:** At the specified conditions (Al20Zn80, 870K, equilibrium), the system is entirely liquid with a liquid phase fraction of 1.0000 (100%) and zero solid phases present.\n\n**Evidence:** CALPHAD equilibrium calculation using the validated COST 507 Al-alloys database shows unambiguously that the alloy is above its liquidus temperature at 870K. No solid phases were detected above the 10\u207b\u00b3 fraction threshold.\n\n**Rationale:** The claim requires \u226599.5% solid fraction to be considered \"a solid,\" but the actual state is 0% solid and 100% liquid. This represents a complete contradiction of the claim with no threshold ambiguity. The result is physically consistent with known Al-Zn phase diagram behavior, where 870K (597\u00b0C) exceeds the liquidus temperature for this Zn-rich composition.\n\n**Confidence:** High. CALPHAD is the gold-standard method for equilibrium phase predictions in well-studied binary systems like Al-Zn. The result is deterministic, unambiguous, and requires no additional verification."
