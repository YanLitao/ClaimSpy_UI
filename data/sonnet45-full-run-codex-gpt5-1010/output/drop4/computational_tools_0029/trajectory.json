This is a well-defined magnetic property measurable via VSM/SQUID magnetometry or computable via DFT (total magnetic moment per formula unit). No proxy is needed; we evaluate Ms directly.\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\n- **CHGNet MLIP**: CHGNet can compute magnetic moments and structural properties for oxide systems. It should represent Fe\u2082O\u2083 and Co-doped variants. However, CHGNet's magnetic moment predictions may have limitations for antiferromagnetic/weak ferromagnetic systems like hematite.\n- **CALPHAD**: Not appropriate - CALPHAD addresses phase equilibria and thermodynamics, not magnetic properties.\n- **Search**: Can provide experimental literature values for Ms of undoped and Co-doped hematite for comparison.\n\nThe most appropriate tool is **CHGNet MLIP** for computing magnetic moments, supplemented by **search** for experimental validation/ranges.\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n- Common units: emu/g (CGS), A\u00b7m\u00b2/kg (SI), or \u03bcB per formula unit\n- Conversions: 1 emu/g = 1 A\u00b7m\u00b2/kg; \u03bcB/f.u. requires molecular weight\n- Baseline: Pure hematite (\u03b1-Fe\u2082O\u2083) is a canted antiferromagnet with weak ferromagnetism. Reported Ms values are typically 0.3-0.4 emu/g at room temperature due to spin canting (Morin transition below ~260 K). We must reproduce this baseline before evaluating doped systems.\n- A 10% increase would mean Ms ~ 0.33-0.44 emu/g for doped samples if undoped is 0.3-0.4 emu/g.\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n1. Compute Ms for undoped Fe\u2082O\u2083 (baseline validation)\n2. Compute Ms for Co-doped Fe\u2082O\u2083 at one or more doping levels (e.g., Fe\u2081.\u2089Co\u2080.\u2081O\u2083 or similar)\n3. Calculate relative change: \u0394Ms/Ms(undoped)\n4. Compare against 10% threshold accounting for computational uncertainty\n5. Cross-check with literature via search for experimental values\n\n**Stop rule**: If computational results show \u226510% increase at any reasonable doping level, claim is supported (existential). If all tested levels show <10% or negative change beyond uncertainty, claim is refuted.\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n## Tool Plan\n\n<ToolPlan>\n**Primary approach**: Use CHGNet MLIP to compute magnetic moments for undoped and Co-doped Fe\u2082O\u2083.\n\n**Sequence**:\n1. **CHGNet MLIP** (cost 7, 1 call): Compute saturation magnetization for:\n   - Undoped Fe\u2082O\u2083 (baseline)\n   - Co-doped Fe\u2082O\u2083 at representative doping level(s)\n   - Compare results against 10% threshold\n\n2. **Search** (cost 3, \u22642 queries if needed): \n   - Query 1: Experimental values for saturation magnetization of undoped hematite (baseline validation)\n   - Query 2 (if needed): Experimental data on Co-doped hematite magnetization for cross-validation\n\n**Rationale**: \n- CHGNet can directly compute magnetic properties, making it the most appropriate computational tool\n- CALPHAD is not suitable for magnetic properties\n- Search provides experimental context and validation\n- This is an existential claim, so finding one positive instance suffices\n\n**Cost**: CHGNet (7) + potentially 1-2 search queries (3-6) = 10-13 total, well within budget\n</ToolPlan>\n\nNow I'll proceed with the CHGNet MLIP tool to compute magnetic properties.",

Experimental hematite has Ms ~ 0.3-0.4 emu/g due to weak ferromagnetism from spin canting. The CHGNet result of 350 emu/g suggests it computed the **theoretical maximum** assuming full ferromagnetic alignment of all Fe\u00b3\u207a spins, not the actual canted antiferromagnetic ground state.\n\n2. **Magnetic Moment Per Formula Unit**: The reported 10 \u03bcB/f.u. for undoped Fe\u2082O\u2083 confirms full ferromagnetic alignment (2 Fe\u00b3\u207a \u00d7 5 \u03bcB = 10 \u03bcB). Real hematite has a net moment of ~0.01-0.02 \u03bcB/f.u. due to slight spin canting.\n\n3. **Physical Representation Failure**: CHGNet appears unable to represent the **antiferromagnetic ordering** and **spin canting** that define hematite's magnetic behavior. It defaulted to a ferromagnetic configuration, which is not the ground state.\n\n4. **Direction of Change**: The CHGNet results show Co-doping **decreases** Ms by 1-2%, contrary to the claim's assertion of a 10% increase. However, this is based on an unphysical baseline.\n\n**Conclusion from CHGNet**: The tool **fails the representation gate** for this problem. CHGNet cannot properly model the antiferromagnetic/weak ferromagnetic nature of hematite, making its predictions unreliable for this claim.\n\n## Revised Strategy\n\nSince CHGNet has failed to represent the system properly, I need to:\n\n1. **Use search_tool** to find experimental data on:\n   - Baseline Ms values for undoped hematite (to establish proper reference)\n   - Experimental studies of Co-doped hematite magnetization\n   - Whether 10% enhancement has been observed experimentally\n\nThis is now the most appropriate path forward, as the computational tool has proven inadequate for this antiferromagnetic system.\n\n**Stop Rule Check**: The claim is NOT yet verified or refuted.

Score & Rationale\n\n**Score: INCONCLUSIVE / NOT VERIFIED**\n\n**Rationale**: \nThe claim requires demonstration that single-phase Co substitution on Fe sites in hematite can increase Ms by \u226510%. Within the available tools and search budget:\n\n1. **Computational verification failed**: CHGNet cannot represent the antiferromagnetic/weak ferromagnetic nature of hematite, producing unphysical results 100\u00d7 above experimental values. The tool lacks the necessary representation of magnetic ordering for this system.\n\n2. **Experimental verification incomplete**: The only relevant experimental study found reports phase separation (\u03b1-Fe\u2082O\u2083 + CoFe\u2082O\u2084 spinels) rather than single-phase substitutional doping. This violates the claim's specification of \"doping cobalt onto the iron sites\" and is out of scope.\n\n3. **No decisive evidence**: Neither supporting nor refuting evidence was obtained for the specific scenario described (single-phase Co-substituted hematite with measured Ms enhancement).\n\nThe claim remains **unverified** due to:\n- Tool representation failure (CHGNet)\n- Absence of in-scope experimental data (single-phase Co-substituted hematite)\n- Exhausted search budget without finding matched-condition primary data\n\nThis is **not a refutation** - it is a determination that available evidence is insufficient to verify the claim within the stated scope and constraints.\n\n### 9. Sanity/Consistency Checks\n\n\u2713 **Units**: Baseline values (0.69-4.58 emu/g) are physically reasonable for weak ferromagnetic hematite  \n\u2717 **Baseline reproduction**: CHGNet failed to reproduce experimental baseline (349.7 vs 0.69-4.58 emu/g)  \n\u2713 **Proxy disclosure**: No proxy used; Ms evaluated directly  \n\u2713 **Score-narrative agreement**: INCONCLUSIVE score matches lack of in-scope evidence  \n\u2713 **Scope fidelity**: Out-of-scope evidence (phase-separated samples, unphysical computational states) correctly excluded  \n\n### 10. What Would Change the Score\n\n**To SUPPORT the claim**:\n- Experimental VSM/SQUID data on **single-phase** Fe\u2082\u208b\u2093Co\u2093O\u2083 (verified by XRD/neutron diffraction) showing Ms \u2265 1.10 \u00d7 Ms(undoped) at any x value\n- DFT calculations with proper treatment of antiferromagnetic ordering (e.g., DFT+U with explicit spin configurations) showing enhanced net moment with Co substitution\n\n**To REFUTE the claim**:\n- Systematic experimental study of single-phase Co-substituted hematite across multiple doping levels showing Ms consistently <1.10 \u00d7 Ms(undoped)\n- First-principles calculations demonstrating that Co\u00b3\u207a substitution cannot increase net magnetization due to magnetic coupling constraints\n\n**Key requirement**: Evidence must be for **single-phase substitutional doping**, not phase-separated mixtures or unphysical computational states.",
  "answer": "**INCONCLUSIVE / NOT VERIFIED**\n\nThe claim that cobalt doping onto iron sites in hematite can increase saturation magnetization by up to 10% could not be verified with available tools and evidence.\n\n**Key findings**:\n1. **CHGNet MLIP failed the representation gate**: Computed unphysical ferromagnetic state (Ms ~ 350 emu/g) instead of hematite's actual canted antiferromagnetic ground state (Ms ~ 0.3-4 emu/g). Results are invalid for this system.\n\n2. **Experimental literature search**: Found one Co-doping study, but it reports phase separation (\u03b1-Fe\u2082O\u2083 + CoFe\u2082O\u2084 spinel phases) rather than single-phase substitutional doping specified in the claim. This is out of scope.\n\n3. **Evidence gap**: No experimental data or valid computational results were found for single-phase Co-substituted hematite (Fe\u2082\u208b\u2093Co\u2093O\u2083) with measured saturation magnetization values.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim remains unverified due to tool limitations (antiferromagnetic systems not properly represented) and absence of matched-condition experimental data within search budget. This is not a refutation\u2014the claim may be valid, but available evidence is insufficient to confirm or deny it within the specified scope of single-phase substitutional doping."
