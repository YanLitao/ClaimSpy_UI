  "reasoning": "0 (Cannot determine) because no condition-matched, single-phase evidence shows a \u226510% Ms increase from Co substitution on Fe sites in hematite, and the only computational results are invalid for hematite\u2019s magnetic ground state. Experimental reports located show phase separation (\u03b1-Fe2O3 + CoFe2O4), which is out of scope for the claim.\n\nClaim decomposition (minima that must hold):\n- Single-phase \u03b1-Fe2O3 with Co substituting on Fe sites (no spinel/secondary phases).\n- Ms measured under comparable conditions to undoped (ambient, similar size/morphology) to support a fair \u226510% increase.\n- Proper magnetic ordering accounted for (hematite\u2019s canted AFM).\n\nEvidence mapping:\n- Direct, matching: None found for single-phase Fe2\u2212xCoxO3 showing \u226510% Ms increase.\n- Proxy/misaligned: CHGNet predicts unphysical ferromagnetic Ms and trends; excluded. Literature hit shows phase separation into CoFe2O4; excluded.\n- Contradictions: None directly against the claim under the specified single-phase condition.\n\nWhy not other scores:\n- Not +1/+2: Missing any direct, in-scope demonstration; computational tool is unsuitable for this system\u2019s magnetism.\n- Not \u22121: No credible evidence that single-phase Co substitution fails to yield up to 10% Ms increase; absence of evidence is not evidence of impossibility.\n- Not \u22122: No fundamental thermodynamic or magnetic reason shown that makes the claim impossible.\n\nAssumptions/limitations:\n- Ms in hematite is highly sensitive to size/morphology and Morin transition; fair comparisons require matched microstructure.\n- Site occupancy and absence of spinel impurities must be verified (e.g., XRD/Rietveld, possibly M\u00f6ssbauer or neutron diffraction).",
