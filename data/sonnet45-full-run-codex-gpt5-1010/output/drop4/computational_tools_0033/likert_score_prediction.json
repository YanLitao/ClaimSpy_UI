  "reasoning": "0 (Cannot determine). The claim requires that Cu in solid solution within \u03b1-Al measurably and significantly (\u2265~5%) increases the elastic modulus of the primary phase under typical conditions, excluding precipitate effects. Necessary minima: (i) Cu dissolves in \u03b1\u2011Al (true but limited by solubility); (ii) E is measured/estimated for the \u03b1\u2011Al solid solution only; (iii) the increase vs pure Al is significant. Evidence mapping: no direct, condition\u2011matched experimental data was found; the CHGNet modeling baseline for pure Al E is grossly wrong (~10 GPa vs ~69\u201370 GPa), making its trend unusable; general metallurgy references suggest Al alloy E varies only a few percent across compositions, hinting against a large increase, but this is indirect and not isolated to the solid\u2011solution state. Decision: With no validated computation or direct measurements isolating solid\u2011solution Cu in \u03b1\u2011Al, and with \u201csignificant\u201d unquantified in the source claim, feasibility cannot be determined. Why not \u20131: although handbook trends suggest small changes, we lack targeted, phase\u2011pure data to probably refute the claim as stated. Why not +1/+2: no direct or validated support under matching conditions. Assumptions: ambient conditions; dilute Cu within \u03b1\u2011Al solubility; \u201csignificant\u201d \u22735%.",
