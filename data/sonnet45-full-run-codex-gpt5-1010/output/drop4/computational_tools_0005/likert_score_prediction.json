  "reasoning": "+2 (Feasible) because condition-matched thermodynamic evidence shows a substantial, nonzero carbide fraction at 1500 K for Al30Si55C15, directly satisfying the claim that heating to 1500 K is insufficient to dissolve all carbides.\n\n- Claim decomposition (minima to be true):\n  1) At T = 1500 K and composition Al30Si55C15, at least one carbide phase has a nonzero equilibrium fraction.\n  2) The conditions align with the claim (ambient pressure, bulk composition).\n  3) \u201cInsufficient to dissolve all\u201d is met if carbide fraction remains above a minimal threshold (e.g., >0\u20131%).\n- Evidence:\n  - Direct (matching conditions): CALPHAD (COST507R) at 1500 K for Al30Si55C15 yields ~30 mol% SiC with phases = SiC + Liquid; carbides persist from 1000\u20132000 K. This exceeds any reasonable \u201ccomplete dissolution\u201d threshold by a large margin.\n  - Mechanistic plausibility: SiC is highly refractory with limited solubility in Al/Si melts; complete dissolution at 1500 K is unlikely.\n  - Contradictions: None presented.\n- Why not other scores:\n  - Not 0/\u20131: Evidence is direct, quantitative, and exactly condition-aligned; no balanced or contradictory data.\n  - Not +1: No critical element is missing for this claim; equilibrium nonzero carbide fraction alone proves \u201cinsufficient to dissolve all.\u201d\n  - Not \u20132: The claim is supported, not contradicted.\n- Assumptions/limitations:\n  - Assumes the CALPHAD database reliably covers Al\u2013Si\u2013C with SiC stability (reasonable).\n  - Kinetics are not required to adjudicate the claim; equilibrium nonzero fraction suffices to prove \u201cinsufficient to dissolve all.\u201d",
