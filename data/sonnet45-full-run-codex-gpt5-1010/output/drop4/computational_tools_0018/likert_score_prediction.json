  "reasoning": "+2 (Feasible) because both established semiconductor physics and a direct (condition\u2011matched) computational result indicate that substitutional P in crystalline Si has substantially lower formation energy than interstitial P, with a large energetic margin.\n\nClaim decomposition (minima that must hold):\n- System/phase: Dilute P point defects in crystalline Si (diamond structure) under ambient pressure.\n- Configurations: P_sub (substitutional on Si site) vs P_int (interstitial, e.g., tetrahedral).\n- Property/metric: Formation energy difference \u0394E_f = E_f(P_int) \u2212 E_f(P_sub) > 0 under typical Fermi levels/charge states relevant to doping.\n- Scope: Isolated defects (dilute limit); general stability comparison (not restricted to a narrow, exotic condition).\n\nEvidence mapping:\n- Direct (model): CHGNet MLIP on a 2\u00d72\u00d72 Si supercell gives \u0394E_f \u2248 +1.81 eV (interstitial higher), comfortably larger than kT and typical model errors, aligning with the claim.\n- Indirect but strong: Long-standing practice and measurements in Si show P is an active shallow donor when substitutional; interstitial P is transient during diffusion/implantation and converts to substitutional via kick\u2011out/replacement mechanisms. This empirical reality implies lower thermodynamic (and practical) stability for substitutional P relative to interstitial P across relevant conditions.\n- Contradictions: None identified; no credible reports where interstitial P is more stable than substitutional in crystalline Si under ambient conditions.\n\nWhy not other Likert values:\n- \u20132/\u20131: No fundamental or quantitative contradiction; the energetic ordering is supported and the margin is large (~1.8 eV).\n- 0: Not underspecified for the intended comparison; evidence is aligned and direction is unambiguous.\n- +1: A critical element is not missing; we have direct model evidence plus convergent domain knowledge/experimental practice. The effect size far exceeds plausible uncertainties.\n\nAssumptions/limitations:\n- Crystalline Si host, dilute defect limit, ambient pressure; typical Fermi levels relevant to n\u2011type doping.\n- CHGNet is one computational source; however, the qualitative ordering is consistent with decades of diffusion/doping behavior and defect physics in Si.\n- Does not address extreme/nonequilibrium or high\u2011pressure conditions where different defect landscapes might emerge (outside the usual semiconductor context).",
