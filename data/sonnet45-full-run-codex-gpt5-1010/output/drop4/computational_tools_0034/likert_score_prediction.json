  "reasoning": "- Call: \u20131 (Partially Infeasible) because experimental references and basic physical reasoning indicate that dissolved Cu in \u03b1\u2011Al does not significantly decrease the elastic modulus; if anything, E stays ~unchanged or increases slightly (Cu has a much higher modulus than Al).\n- Minima to satisfy the claim: (i) Cu is dissolved in single\u2011phase \u03b1\u2011Al (no precipitates), (ii) property is Young\u2019s modulus of the \u03b1\u2011Al matrix, (iii) effect direction is a significant decrease (\u2265 about a few percent) relative to pure Al under typical conditions.\n- Evidence: Baseline E(Al) \u2248 69\u201370 GPa; reported Al\u2013Cu alloys at room temperature show E \u2248 70\u201375 GPa (directionally an increase or no change, not a decrease). This directly contradicts the claim\u2019s asserted decrease and \u201csignificant\u201d magnitude. Mechanistically, adding a stiffer solute (Cu, E\u2248130 GPa) to Al should not reduce E of the solid solution.\n- Why not \u20132: Not fundamentally impossible for some solutes/conditions to reduce modulus; the claim is likely wrong as stated for Cu, but not a physics impossibility.\n- Why not 0/+1/+2: Directional contradiction with condition\u2011matched data argues against 0; there\u2019s no partial support for the claimed decrease (so not +1 or +2).\n- Assumptions: Room\u2011temperature, single\u2011phase \u03b1\u2011Al within Cu solubility; modest definition of \u201csignificant\u201d (~\u22655%).",
