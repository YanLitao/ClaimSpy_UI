ALL THREE compositions satisfy the criteria, providing strong support.\n\n**Phase identification**: The CALPHAD tool explicitly identifies \"TAU\" phase, confirming it is represented in the COST507 database and is the ternary intermetallic referenced in the claim.\n\n**Mole vs. mass/volume fractions**: The results are on a mole basis. For metallic phases with similar densities, mole% and vol% are typically close. The tau phase fractions (4.4-17.0 mole%) are comfortably below the 20% threshold regardless of the basis.\n\n## Stop Rule Assessment\n\nPer the guidelines:\n- **Existential claim**: \"one solid in-scope positive instance above \u03b8 suffices \u2192 stop\"\n- We have THREE positive instances, all well within specifications\n- No need for additional tools (search, cross-validation) as the evidence is clear and decisive\n- CALPHAD is the ideal tool for this equilibrium thermodynamics question\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe claim is **SUPPORTED**.

  "answer": "# CLAIM VERIFICATION REPORT: computational_tools_0026\n\n## 1. Claim (Verbatim)\n\"In lightweight alloys consisting mostly of aluminum and small fractions of magnesium (<8 at.%) and zinc (<4 at.%), slowly solidifying from the melt leads to a mechanically desirable two-phase equilibrium between a primary fcc phase and up to 20% fraction of a three-component 'tau' phase.\"\n\n## 2. Scope Lock\n- **System:** Al-Mg-Zn ternary alloy\n- **Composition constraints:** Al-rich with Mg < 8 at.%, Zn < 4 at.%\n- **Process:** Slow solidification from melt (equilibrium cooling)\n- **Final state:** Room temperature equilibrium\n- **Pressure:** Ambient (1 atm, assumed)\n- **Measurement context:** Equilibrium phase constitution and fractions\n\n## 3. Evaluation Type\n**Existential claim** (\"leads to\" indicates that this two-phase equilibrium CAN be achieved, not that it occurs universally across all compositions in the range)\n\n## 4. Target FoM & Units\n1. **Phase constitution:** Identity and count of equilibrium phases (binary: present/absent)\n2. **Phase fractions:** Mole% or mass% of each phase\n3. **Specific metrics:**\n   - Exactly 2 phases: fcc + tau\n   - fcc is primary (majority) phase\n   - Tau phase fraction \u2264 20%\n\n**Units:** at.% (composition), mole% (phase fractions from CALPHAD)\n\n## 5. Plan\n**Tool:** CALPHAD (cost 5, 1 call)\n**Test design:** Evaluate equilibrium at 298 K for three representative compositions:\n- Al-4Mg-2Zn at.% (mid-range)\n- Al-7Mg-3Zn at.% (near upper bounds)\n- Al-2Mg-1Zn at.% (lower range)\n\n**Rationale:** CALPHAD directly computes equilibrium phases and fractions; ideal tool-question fit. Three compositions provide robustness across the claim range.\n\n## 6. Evidence Table\n\n| Composition (at.%) | Temperature | Database | FCC_A1 (mole%) | TAU (mole%) | Other Phases | In-Scope |\n|-------------------|-------------|----------|----------------|-------------|--------------|----------|\n| Al-94Mg-4Zn-2     | 298 K       | COST507  | 90.6           | 9.4         | None         | \u2713        |\n| Al-90Mg-7Zn-3     | 298 K       | COST507  | 83.0           | 17.0        | None         | \u2713        |\n| Al-97Mg-2Zn-1     | 298 K       | COST507  | 95.6           | 4.4         | None         | \u2713        |\n\n**Setup details:**\n- Method: pycalphad equilibrium calculation\n- Database: COST507 (cost507R.TDB)\n- Pressure: 101325 Pa (1 atm)\n- Convergence: Standard pycalphad equilibrium solver\n\n**Raw output \u2192 FoM conversion:** Direct output in mole fractions; no conversion needed.\n\n**Uncertainty:** CALPHAD predictions for well-characterized systems typically \u00b12-5% in phase fractions; all tau fractions are well separated from the 20% threshold.\n\n## 7. Synthesis\n**Direction:** All three compositions exhibit the claimed two-phase equilibrium (fcc + tau).\n\n**Magnitude vs. claim:**\n- **Phase count:** Exactly 2 phases in all cases \u2713\n- **Primary phase:** fcc is majority (83.0-95.6%) \u2713\n- **Tau presence:** Confirmed in all compositions (4.4-17.0%) \u2713\n- **Tau fraction threshold:** All values well below 20% (max 17.0%) \u2713\n\n**Composition dependence:** Tau fraction increases with Mg and Zn content (4.4% \u2192 9.4% \u2192 17.0%), consistent with ternary intermetallic formation.\n\n**Out-of-scope note:** The qualifier \"mechanically desirable\" is subjective and not evaluated. The phase constitution claim is verified independently of mechanical properties.\n\n## 8. Score & Rationale\n**SCORE: STRONGLY SUPPORTED**\n\n**Rationale:** The claim asserts an existential statement\u2014that slow solidification of Al-Mg-Zn alloys in the specified composition range CAN produce a two-phase fcc + tau equilibrium with tau \u2264 20%. CALPHAD calculations using the validated COST507 database demonstrate that ALL THREE tested compositions (spanning the claim range) satisfy every criterion:\n1. Exactly two phases present\n2. fcc is the primary phase\n3. Tau phase present with fractions of 4.4%, 9.4%, and 17.0%\u2014all comfortably below the 20% threshold\n\nThe threshold \u03b8 (tau \u2264 20%) is met with margin (max 17.0%), and the existential quantifier is satisfied by multiple positive instances. The evidence is direct, in-scope, and from the ideal tool for equilibrium thermodynamics.\n\n## 9. Sanity/Consistency Checks\n\u2713 **Units round-trip:** at.% input \u2192 mole% output; consistent and appropriate\n\u2713 **Baseline match:** FCC_A1 identified as Al-rich fcc solid solution (expected primary phase)\n\u2713 **Phase nomenclature:** TAU phase explicitly present in COST507 database for Al-Mg-Zn\n\u2713 **Proxy disclosure:** No proxy used; direct measurement of target FoMs\n\u2713 **Score-narrative agreement:** \"Strongly Supported\" aligns with all criteria satisfied across multiple compositions\n\u2713 **Composition verification:** All test points within claim bounds (Mg < 8%, Zn < 4%)\n\u2713 **Physical reasonableness:** Results consistent with known Al-alloy behavior (fcc matrix + intermetallic precipitates)\n\n## 10. What Would Change the Score\n**To refute:** Experimental measurements at matched conditions (slow cooling, same compositions, room temperature) showing:\n- More than 2 phases present, OR\n- Tau phase fraction consistently > 20%, OR\n- Tau phase absent in the composition range\n\n**To strengthen:** \n- Experimental validation of tau phase fractions via XRD/SEM quantification\n- Independent CALPHAD database (e.g., TCAL) showing consistent results\n- Demonstration that mole% \u2192 vol% conversion maintains tau < 20%\n\n**Current confidence:** High. CALPHAD is the gold-standard tool for equilibrium phase predictions in well-characterized alloy systems. The COST507 database is validated for Al-Mg-Zn. Multiple compositions provide robustness."
