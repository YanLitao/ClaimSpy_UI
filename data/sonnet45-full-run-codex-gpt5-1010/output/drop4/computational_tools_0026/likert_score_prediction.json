  "reasoning": "+2 (Feasible) because direct, condition\u2011matched CALPHAD evidence shows that Al\u2011rich Al\u2011Mg\u2011Zn alloys within Mg < 8 at.% and Zn < 4 at.% can equilibrate (slow solidification \u2192 near\u2011equilibrium) at room temperature into exactly two phases: a primary fcc (A1) matrix with a ternary tau intermetallic at \u226420% (observed 4\u201317%).\n\nClaim decomposition (minima):\n- Composition: Al\u2011rich; Mg < 8 at.%, Zn < 4 at.%.\n- Process/conditions: slow solidification from melt \u2192 ambient\u2011pressure, room\u2011temperature equilibrium.\n- Phase constitution: exactly two phases, fcc (majority) + ternary tau; tau fraction \u2264 20%.\n\nEvidence mapping:\n- Direct (CALPHAD, COST507, 298 K): Three compositions (Al\u20114Mg\u20112Zn; Al\u20117Mg\u20113Zn; Al\u20112Mg\u20111Zn) yield only FCC_A1 (83\u201396%) + TAU (4.4\u201317.0%). All criteria met and well within threshold.\n- Database coverage: Tau phase is explicitly represented for Al\u2011Mg\u2011Zn in COST507.\n\nWhy not other scores:\n- Not +1: No missing critical element for the phase\u2011equilibrium part; multiple in\u2011range points satisfy all minima with margin.\n- Not 0/\u20131/\u20132: No contradictions with phase diagrams/thermodynamics; method is fit\u2011for\u2011purpose; results are internally consistent and within the stated bounds.\n\nAssumptions/limitations:\n- Interprets \u201cleads to\u201d as achievable under equilibrium/near\u2011equilibrium slow cooling (standard for CALPHAD validation).\n- \u201cMechanically desirable\u201d is qualitative and not adjudicated; feasibility judged on phase constitution only.\n- Single thermodynamic database used; independent database/experiments would further cement robustness but are not required for feasibility.",
