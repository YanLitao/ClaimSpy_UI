  "reasoning": "-2 (Infeasible) because Cu substitution in fcc Al is well known to cause a lattice contraction, not an increase; the agent\u2019s CHGNet calculations show consistent negative Vegard-like \u0394a/a0 up to ~\u22120.47% at ~4 at.% Cu, and the size-misfit rationale (r_Cu < r_Al) supports this direction. The claim\u2019s core directional statement (\u201cincrease\u201d) contradicts established behavior under the stated/dilute solid-solution conditions.\n\nNecessary minima:\n- Cu forms substitutional defects in fcc Al at dilute concentrations (true/plausible).\n- The equilibrium lattice parameter of the primary fcc Al phase increases with Cu content (false per evidence).\n- Conditions: equilibrium, dilute solid solution, ambient pressure (typical for Al\u2013Cu; aligned).\n\nEvidence mapping:\n- Direct/modeling (aligned): CHGNet MLIP for 0.9\u20134.6 at.% Cu gives \u0394a/a0 < 0 throughout, reaching ~\u22120.47% near 3\u20134 at.%.\n- Mechanistic/indirect: Atomic size mismatch (Cu smaller than Al) and standard Vegard\u2019s-law expectations predict contraction for Cu in Al; consistent with metallurgical trends for Al\u2013Cu solid solutions.\n\nWhy not other scores:\n- Not \u22121: The problem is directional (increase vs decrease), a fundamental contradiction not resolved by narrowing typical conditions.\n- Not 0: Conditions and evidence are aligned; the direction is not indeterminate.\n- Not +1/+2: The claim\u2019s asserted direction is opposite to evidence.\n\nAssumptions/limits:\n- Assumes substitutional, dilute solid solution (no precipitates like \u03b8-Al2Cu).\n- Modeling-based confirmation; literature cross-citations not included here but trend is broadly established.",
