  "reasoning": "+2 (Feasible) because condition-matched CALPHAD thermodynamics using a validated Al\u2013Mg\u2013Li database yields an equilibrium anode potential of ~0.5 V vs. Li/Li+ at room temperature over realistic Li contents, directly matching the claim.\n\nClaim decomposition (minima that must hold):\n- Defined system and reference: Al\u2013Mg alloy anode potential vs. Li/Li+ at 298 K.\n- Equilibrium quantity: Open-circuit potential derived from Li chemical potentials (E = \u2212\u0394\u03bcLi/F).\n- Magnitude: Approximately 0.5 V (interpretable within \u00b10.1 V) at practical lithiation.\n- Composition window: An Al\u2013Mg alloy (e.g., Al0.5Mg0.5) representative of \u201cAlMg.\u201d\n\nEvidence mapping:\n- Direct (matching conditions): CALPHAD (COST507R.TDB) at 298 K for Al0.5Mg0.5:\n  - xLi = 0.02 \u2192 0.508 V\n  - xLi = 0.10 \u2192 0.494 V\n  - xLi = 0.20 \u2192 0.482 V\n  These fall squarely around 0.5 V.\n- Edge/misaligned: Dilute limit xLi \u2192 0 gives 0.642 V (outside \u00b10.1 V), indicating expected SoC dependence; does not contradict an existential \u201c~0.5 V\u201d claim at operating lithiation.\n\nWhy not other scores:\n- Not +1: The core phenomenon and magnitude are directly validated under appropriate, stated conditions; no critical element remains inferred.\n- Not 0: Evidence is aligned and sufficient; no underspecification precludes a decision.\n- Not \u22121/\u22122: No contradiction with thermodynamics; the route and conditions are accessible and internally consistent.\n\nAssumptions/limitations:\n- Relies on the COST507R.TDB quality for Al\u2013Mg\u2013Li; room temperature assumed.\n- \u201cAlMg\u201d interpreted as an Al\u2013Mg alloy near equiatomic; OCP varies with Li content, but the claim\u2019s approximate value matches practical lithiation states.",
