  "reasoning": "- Call: \u20131 (Partially Infeasible) because a eutectic in Al\u2013Zn is accepted, but the claimed composition \u201caround 88 at% Zn\u201d is contradicted by condition\u2011matched CALPHAD evidence indicating the eutectic occurs near 67 at% Zn.\n- Minima to be true: (1) Al\u2013Zn has a eutectic reaction; (2) it occurs at \u224888 at% Zn at ambient pressure/equilibrium; (3) phase assemblage and temperature are consistent. \n- Evidence mapping:\n  - Direct (CALPHAD, COST 507 Al-alloys DB): eutectic L \u2192 FCC_A1 + HCP_ZN at 654.2 K and 67.3 at% Zn (contradicts the claimed \u224888 at% Zn by ~20 at%).\n- Why not \u20132: The core phenomenon (existence of a eutectic) is not impossible; only the stated composition window is off.\n- Why not 0: The evidence is clear and condition-matched, not merely insufficient.\n- Why not +1/+2: The claimed composition window is far from the computed eutectic composition.\n- Assumptions/limits: Ambient pressure, equilibrium; reliance on a validated thermodynamic database. Possible weight% vs at% confusion noted, but per the provided CALPHAD evidence the eutectic is not near 88 at% Zn.",
