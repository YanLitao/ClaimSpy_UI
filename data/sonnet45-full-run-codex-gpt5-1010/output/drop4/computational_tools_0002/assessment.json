      "text": "The claim asserts that Al and Zn form a eutectic around 88 at% Zn. CALPHAD calculation using the validated COST 507 Al-alloys database identifies the eutectic at 67.3 at% Zn at 654.2 K, with the phase reaction LIQUID \u2192 FCC_A1 + HCP_ZN. This represents a deviation of 20.7 at% from the claimed composition, which is more than 10 times the reasonable threshold (\u00b12 at%) for 'around'.",

The claimed range of 86-90 at% Zn (88 \u00b1 2 at%) is far from the computed 67.3 at% Zn, placing the claim in the 'partially infeasible' category rather than 'extremely infeasible' since the eutectic itself exists.",
