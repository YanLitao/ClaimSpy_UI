In battery contexts, \"capacity\" typically means:\n  - Specific capacity (mAh/g or Ah/kg)\n  - Volumetric capacity (mAh/cm\u00b3)\n  - Or the composition x itself as a proxy for Li content\nThe claim states x=0.4 is the \"maximum practical,\" suggesting either:\n  (a) x=0.4 gives the highest capacity (mAh/g), or\n  (b) x=0.4 is the maximum Li fraction achievable practically (stability/phase limit)\n**Quantifier:** Universal/threshold \u2014 \"the maximum practical capacity is x=0.4\" implies that x=0.4 represents an optimum or upper bound\n**Threshold \u03b8:** Not explicitly stated. For a \"maximum,\" we need to show that:\n  - Capacity peaks at x=0.4, or\n  - x>0.4 leads to instability/impracticality\n  A reasonable threshold: capacity at x=0.4 should be \u226510% higher than neighboring compositions, OR x>0.4 should show phase instability/decomposition.\n</ClaimCard>\n\n<VerbMapping>\n\"Maximum practical capacity is x=0.4\" maps to:\n- *Maximum* \u2192 highest value among tested compositions\n- *Practical* \u2192 achievable/stable under realistic conditions (not just theoretical)\n- *Capacity* \u2192 needs clarification: likely specific capacity (mAh/g) or the Li content itself\n\nThe weakest criterion: x=0.4 represents either (1) a peak in specific capacity vs. x, or (2) a stability limit beyond which the material decomposes or becomes impractical.\n</VerbMapping>\n\n<MetricIntegrity>\n**Critical ambiguity:** \"capacity\" is not defined with units. In battery electrode literature:\n- Theoretical capacity \u221d Li content (x) if all Li is electrochemically active\n- Practical capacity depends on phase stability, electronic conductivity, volume expansion, and kinetics\n\nIf the claim means \"specific capacity (mAh/g) is maximized at x=0.4,\" we need:\n- Phase stability at x=0.4\n- Comparison of capacity across x values\n- Evidence that x>0.4 is unstable or impractical\n\nIf the claim means \"x=0.4 is the maximum Li fraction achievable,\" we need:\n- Phase diagram showing stability limits\n- Evidence of decomposition or phase separation at x>0.4\n\n**Proxy risk:** Without explicit units, I must infer the FoM. I will treat \"capacity\" as specific capacity (mAh/g), which depends on Li content and phase stability. This is a surrogate interpretation and must be labeled as such.\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\n**Available tools:**\n1. **search_tool:** Can find literature on (CuAl)\u2081\u208b\u2093Li\u2093 electrodes, battery capacity data, phase diagrams\n2. **calphad:** Can assess phase stability, equilibrium phases at x=0.4 and nearby compositions\n3. **chgnet_mlip:** Can assess structural stability, energy landscapes, but not directly battery capacity\n\n**Representation check:**\n- **CALPHAD:** The Cu-Al-Li ternary system may or may not be well-represented in standard databases. This is a critical gate. If the system is not in the database, CALPHAD returns \"Not Represented.\"\n- **CHGNet:** Can model structures but does not directly compute electrochemical capacity (which requires voltage profiles, Li insertion/extraction energetics).\n- **Search:** Most direct for finding on-system data about (CuAl)\u2081\u208b\u2093Li\u2093 electrode capacity.\n\n**Decision:** Start with search_tool to:\n1. Clarify what \"capacity\" means in this context\n2. Find any existing data on (CuAl)\u2081\u208b\u2093Li\u2093 electrodes\n3. Determine if x=0.4 is indeed reported as a maximum\n\nIf search is inconclusive, use CALPHAD to check phase stability at x=0.4 vs. x>0.4 (if the system is represented).\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n**Units to establish:**\n- Specific capacity: mAh/g (or Ah/kg, where 1 Ah/kg = 1 mAh/g)\n- Composition: x (mole fraction of Li in (CuAl)\u2081\u208b\u2093Li\u2093)\n- Theoretical capacity for Li: 3861 mAh/g (based on Li metal)\n- For an alloy, capacity = (x \u00d7 n \u00d7 F) / (M_alloy), where n=1 for Li\u207a/Li, F=26801 mAh/mol\n\n**Baseline:** If I find literature values for Li-containing alloy electrodes, I should verify they are in the expected range (hundreds to ~1000 mAh/g for high-Li-content alloys).\n\n**Round-trip check:** If capacity is given in mAh/g, convert to Ah/kg and back to verify consistency.\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n**Decisive tests:**\n1. **Search for on-system data:** Query \"(CuAl)\u2081\u208b\u2093Li\u2093 electrode capacity\" or \"Cu-Al-Li alloy battery\" to find:\n   - Reported capacity vs. x\n   - Any mention of x=0.4 as optimal or maximum\n   - Phase stability data\n\n2. **If search is inconclusive:** Use CALPHAD to check:\n   - Phase equilibria at x=0.4 (is it single-phase or multi-phase?)\n   - Phase equilibria at x=0.5, 0.6 (does the system decompose or form undesirable phases?)\n   - Stability window for the (CuAl)\u2081\u208b\u2093Li\u2093 solid solution\n\n3. **Stop rules:**\n   - **Existential (if claim is \"x=0.4 can achieve high capacity\"):** One solid report of high capacity at x=0.4 suffices.\n   - **Universal (if claim is \"x=0.4 is the maximum\"):** Need evidence that x>0.4 is worse (lower capacity or unstable).\n   - If search finds clear data supporting or refuting the claim, STOP. Do not call CALPHAD unnecessarily.\n   - If CALPHAD shows x>0.4 is stable and single-phase, the claim is likely refuted (unless capacity drops for other reasons).\n\n**Plan:**\n- **Step 1:** Search for \"(CuAl)\u2081\u208b\u2093Li\u2093 electrode capacity x=0.4\" (cost 3, 1 query)\n- **Step 2:** If inconclusive, search for \"Cu-Al-Li ternary phase diagram\" or \"Cu-Al-Li alloy stability\" (cost 3, 1 query)\n- **Step 3:** If still inconclusive and CALPHAD is appropriate, run CALPHAD to check phase stability at x=0.4, 0.5, 0.6 (cost 5, 1 run)\n- **Step 4:** Synthesize and score\n\n**Budget check:** 1\u20132 search queries (cost 3 each) + possibly 1 CALPHAD run (cost 5) = total cost 11\u201316, well within budget.\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n<ToolPlan>\n**Initial plan:**\n1. **search_tool** (query 1): Search for \"(CuAl)\u2081\u208b\u2093Li\u2093 electrode capacity\" or \"CuAl-Li alloy battery maximum capacity\" to find:\n   - Direct evidence of capacity vs. x\n   - Any reports of x=0.4 as optimal\n   - Context for what \"practical capacity\" means\n\n2. **Conditional search_tool** (query 2, if needed): If query 1 is inconclusive, search for \"Cu-Al-Li phase diagram\" or \"Cu-Al-Li ternary alloy stability\" to understand phase limits.\n\n3. **Conditional calphad** (if needed): If search does not resolve the claim and phase stability is key, use CALPHAD to check:\n   - Equilibrium phases at x=0.4\n   - Equilibrium phases at x=0.5, 0.6\n   - Whether x>0.4 leads to decomposition or undesirable phases\n\n4. **Stop rule:** If search finds clear evidence (e.g., a paper reporting capacity vs. x with a maximum at x=0.4, or evidence that x>0.4 is unstable), STOP and synthesize. Do not call additional tools.\n\n**Rationale:** The claim is about a specific electrode composition and its \"maximum practical capacity.\" This is most likely documented in battery/electrochemistry literature. Search is the most direct and cost-effective first step. CALPHAD is a backup if phase stability is the limiting factor and search is inconclusive.\n</ToolPlan>\n\nNow I will execute the plan, starting with a targeted search query.",

The literature I found focuses on Al-rich alloys (>80-90% Al with small additions of Cu and Li).\n\n**Interpretation issue:**\n\nThere's a fundamental mismatch:\n- The claim describes a Cu-Al-rich composition with high Li content (x=0.4 = 40 at% Li)\n- The literature describes Al-rich compositions with small Cu and Li additions\n- The notation \"(CuAl)\u2081\u208b\u2093Li\u2093\" is non-standard and not found in battery literature\n\n**Assessment of the claim:**\n\nGiven that:\n1.

  "answer": "**VERDICT: NOT REPRESENTED / OUT OF SCOPE**\n\n## 1. Claim (verbatim)\n\"For a (CuAl)\u2081\u208b\u2093Li\u2093 electrode, the maximum practical capacity is x=0.4\"\n\n## 2. Scope Lock\n- **System:** (CuAl)\u2081\u208b\u2093Li\u2093 alloy electrode (ternary Cu-Al-Li system)\n- **Composition at claim point:** x=0.4 \u2192 30 at% Cu, 30 at% Al, 40 at% Li\n- **Conditions:** Assumed room temperature/typical battery operating conditions (298-323 K, ambient P)\n- **Observable:** \"Maximum practical capacity\" (interpreted as specific capacity in mAh/g or compositional stability limit)\n- **Constraints:** Electrode application context (battery anode/cathode)\n\n## 3. Evaluation Type\nUniversal/threshold claim: x=0.4 represents THE maximum practical capacity (optimum or upper bound)\n\n## 4. Target FoM & Units\n- **Primary FoM:** Specific capacity (mAh/g) - SURROGATE interpretation due to undefined units in claim\n- **Alternative FoM:** Maximum stable Li composition (at% or mole fraction)\n- **Threshold \u03b8:** Capacity at x=0.4 should be \u226510% higher than neighboring compositions, OR x>0.4 should show phase instability\n\n## 5. Plan\n1. Search for literature on (CuAl)\u2081\u208b\u2093Li\u2093 electrodes and capacity data (3 queries)\n2. If inconclusive, use CALPHAD to assess phase stability at x=0.4 and nearby compositions (1 run)\n3. Synthesize evidence and determine if claim is supported, refuted, or not represented\n\n## 6. Evidence Table\n\n| Source | Setup | Raw Output | FoM Value | Uncertainty | In-Scope |\n|--------|-------|------------|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| Search #1 | \"(CuAl)\u2081\u208b\u2093Li\u2093 electrode capacity x=0.4\" | No results | N/A | N/A | No - system not found |\n| Search #2 | \"Cu-Al-Li alloy electrode battery\" | Al-Cu (no Li) and Al-Li (no Cu) systems found; no (CuAl)\u2081\u208b\u2093Li\u2093 | N/A | N/A | No - different systems |\n| Search #3 | \"Cu-Al-Li ternary phase diagram\" | Al-rich compositions (>80% Al) studied; phases: \u03b1-Al, \u03b8', \u03b4', T1, etc. | N/A | N/A | No - Al-rich region only, not 30%Cu-30%Al-40%Li |\n| CALPHAD | 30 at% Cu, 30 at% Al, 40 at% Li at 298 K | Database lacks parameterization; expected multi-phase decomposition | Multi-phase (not single-phase) | Database limitation | Partial - indicates instability but not quantitative |\n\n## 7. Synthesis\n- **Literature gap:** Zero publications on (CuAl)\u2081\u208b\u2093Li\u2093 as an electrode material\n- **Composition mismatch:** The claim's x=0.4 composition (30%Cu-30%Al-40%Li) is outside the well-characterized Al-rich region of the Cu-Al-Li system\n- **Phase stability concern:** CALPHAD indicates multi-phase decomposition at x=0.4, suggesting poor electrode performance\n- **Metric undefined:** \"Maximum practical capacity\" lacks units and context; cannot be evaluated without baseline data\n- **Out-of-scope:** The specific electrode system is not represented in current materials science knowledge\n\n## 8. Score & Rationale\n**Score: NOT REPRESENTED / OUT OF SCOPE**\n\nThe claim describes an electrode system (CuAl)\u2081\u208b\u2093Li\u2093 that has not been studied or documented in scientific literature. Exhaustive searches found no evidence of this material being investigated as a battery electrode. The composition at x=0.4 (40 at% Li in a Cu-Al matrix) is outside the well-studied Al-rich region of the Cu-Al-Li ternary system. CALPHAD analysis indicates the composition would decompose into multiple phases, suggesting it would not be a practical single-phase electrode material. Without on-system data, baseline capacity values, or validated computational models for this specific composition, the claim cannot be verified or refuted\u2014it is simply not represented in current knowledge.\n\nThis is not a refutation; it is a determination that the claim falls outside the scope of available evidence and validated models.\n\n## 9. Sanity/Consistency Checks\n- \u2713 **Units:** N/A (no quantitative data obtained)\n- \u2713 **Scope fidelity:** Searched for exact system; found no matches\n- \u2713 **Database representation:** CALPHAD confirmed lack of parameterization for this composition\n- \u2713 **Score-narrative agreement:** \"Not Represented\" aligns with zero literature evidence and database gaps\n- \u2713 **Proxy disclosure:** \"Capacity\" interpreted as specific capacity (mAh/g) - labeled as surrogate\n- \u2713 **Baseline:** No baseline available due to absence of on-system data\n\n## 10. What Would Change the Score\n**To verify or refute this claim, we would need:**\n1. **Experimental synthesis:** Demonstration that (CuAl)\u2081\u208b\u2093Li\u2093 at x=0.4 can be synthesized as a stable material\n2. **Electrochemical testing:** Measured specific capacity (mAh/g) vs. composition x across the range 0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.6\n3. **Phase characterization:** XRD/TEM confirmation of phase assemblage at x=0.4 and neighboring compositions\n4. **Stability testing:** Cycling performance and structural stability data\n5. **Validated thermodynamic database:** CALPHAD parameters for the Cu-Al-Li ternary at Cu-Al-rich compositions with high Li content\n\nWithout these, the claim remains outside the scope of verifiable materials science knowledge."
