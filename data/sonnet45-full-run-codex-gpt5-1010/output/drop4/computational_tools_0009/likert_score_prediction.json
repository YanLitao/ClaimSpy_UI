  "reasoning": "0 (Cannot determine) because the claim\u2019s key elements are underspecified (\u201ccapacity\u201d undefined; conditions absent), the specific (CuAl)1\u2212xLix electrode system at x=0.4 is not represented in the literature, and there is no direct, condition\u2011matched evidence mapping capacity vs x to show a maximum at 0.4. Limited thermodynamic hints (likely multiphase at ~30%Cu\u201330%Al\u201340%Li) suggest potential impracticality but are not decisive for the claim as stated.\n\n- Claim decomposition (minima that must all hold):\n  1) A (CuAl)1\u2212xLix alloy electrode is synthesizable and operable under typical battery conditions.\n  2) The composition at x=0.4 is phase\u2011stable or at least practically cyclable.\n  3) \u201cCapacity\u201d is defined (e.g., specific capacity in mAh g\u22121) with measurement conditions.\n  4) Capacity vs x has been measured or credibly modeled, showing a maximum at x=0.4 under those conditions.\n\n- Evidence mapping:\n  - Direct (matching conditions): None for this system; no studies of (CuAl)1\u2212xLix electrodes or capacity maps.\n  - Indirect/proxy: Cu\u2013Al\u2013Li ternary literature largely Al\u2011rich; CALPHAD attempt suggests likely multiphase at 30%Cu\u201330%Al\u201340%Li but with database limitations.\n  - Contradictions: No direct contradiction to a maximum at x=0.4; rather, an absence of evidence plus thermodynamic caution.\n\n- Why not \u22121:\n  - Although multiphase tendencies hint against practicality at x=0.4, we lack condition\u2011matched capacity data or a defined metric to say the claim is probably wrong as stated.\n- Why not +1 or +2:\n  - No directional support (no measurements or validated modeling showing a capacity maximum at x=0.4); critical elements (system existence as an electrode, property definition, and capacity vs composition data) are missing.\n\n- Assumptions/limitations:\n  - Assumed room\u2011temperature, ambient pressure operation; assumed (CuAl) denotes an equiatomic Cu\u2013Al basis; CALPHAD database gaps limit thermodynamic certainty; \u201ccapacity\u201d presumed to be specific capacity, but undefined in the claim.",
