  "reasoning": "+1 (Partially Feasible) because authoritative Fe\u2013Al phase behavior and the provided CALPHAD results at 973 K show FeAl2 (Al2Fe stoichiometry) forms as Al exceeds ~50 at.% and grows in fraction, but the claim is over\u2011broad on conditions and the \u201csecondary\u201d designation only holds over a limited composition window.\n\n- Minimal elements that must hold:\n  - The referenced \u201cAl2Fe\u201d corresponds to FeAl2 in the binary Fe\u2013Al system.\n  - When Al > ~50 at.%, FeAl2 appears alongside the primary FeAl/B2 matrix (i.e., as a secondary phase) at equilibrium.\n  - This formation is not an artifact of a single, narrow set of conditions.\n\n- Evidence mapping:\n  - Direct (matching property): CALPHAD at 973 K shows FeAl2 present at 50 at.% (\u22480.9%) and increasing with Al content (\u224830% at 55 at.%, \u226560% at 60 at.%); consistent with standard Fe\u2013Al phase diagrams placing FeAl2 on the Al-rich side of FeAl.\n  - Indirect/clarification: Literature confirms FeAl2 is the standard nomenclature (stoichiometry matches \u201cAl2Fe\u201d).\n  - Contradictions: None, but scope nuance\u2014beyond ~60 at.% Al, FeAl2 becomes the primary phase, so \u201csecondary\u201d no longer applies.\n\n- Why not other scores:\n  - Not \u20132/\u20131: No fundamental contradiction; the phenomenon is well supported by phase equilibria.\n  - Not +2: The claim is condition\u2011unspecified (temperature/processing), relies on a single\u2011temperature CALPHAD snapshot, and overgeneralizes the \u201csecondary\u201d status across all \u201c>50 at.%\u201d compositions.\n\n- Assumptions/limitations:\n  - Equilibrium conditions; typical Fe\u2013Al databases are accurate.\n  - Actual microstructures depend on processing/kinetics; exact threshold is temperature dependent.\n  - \u201cAl2Fe\u201d interpreted as FeAl2.",
