  "reasoning": "- \u20131 (Partially Infeasible) because, while the two-phase assemblage Al5Fe2 + Al2Fe at 30 at.% Fe and 750 K is plausible, the claimed phase fractions (5% Al5Fe2, 95% Al2Fe) are contradicted by condition-matched CALPHAD and basic lever-rule reasoning; the magnitude of the discrepancy (~65 percentage points) is decisive.\n- Minima that must hold: (1) At 750 K and 30 at.% Fe, equilibrium involves Al5Fe2 and Al2Fe; (2) Equilibrium phase fractions are 5% Al5Fe2 and 95% Al2Fe.\n- Evidence:\n  - Direct (CALPHAD, PyCalphad with COST 507): Predicts 70% Al5Fe2 and 30% Al2Fe at 750 K, 30 at.% Fe (assemblage correct; fractions inverted vs claim).\n  - Mechanistic/thermodynamic check (lever rule): Bulk (30% Fe) lies closer to Al5Fe2 (28.6% Fe) than to Al2Fe (33.3% Fe), so Al5Fe2 should be the larger fraction\u2014aligns with CALPHAD, contradicts the claim.\n- Why not \u20132: No fundamental impossibility; the phase pair is reasonable at these conditions\u2014the error is quantitative, not categorical.\n- Why not 0: We have strong, condition-matched thermodynamic evidence; not an underspecified or balanced-evidence case.\n- Why not +1/+2: The central numeric claim (phase fractions) is wrong by a large margin; not merely missing a piece of validation.\n\nAssumptions/limits: Uses a reputable Fe\u2013Al database (COST 507); neglects minor solubility/tertiary phases; assumes near-stoichiometric intermetallic tie-line at 750 K.",
