    "thought_0": "Let me begin by conducting the mandatory pre-flight analysis before invoking any tools.\n\n## Pre-Flight Analysis\n\n<PreFlight>\n<ClaimCard>\n- **System/entity**: Al-Mg alloy anode in a lithium battery\n- **State/phase**: Solid anode material (presumably metallic alloy)\n- **Conditions**: Room temperature (typical battery operation, ~298 K), ambient pressure, electrochemical environment (lithium battery electrolyte)\n- **Manipulation**: Alloying Mg into Al (composition not specified, but implies Mg as minor/moderate alloying addition)\n- **Observable/FoM + units**: Battery voltage (V, volts) - specifically the anode potential vs Li/Li\u207a\n- **Quantifier**: Universal (\"increases\" implies a general effect for any Mg addition)\n- **Threshold \u03b8**: Any measurable increase in voltage (>0 V) would satisfy \"increases\"; however, for practical significance in battery context, \u22650.05 V (50 mV) is a reasonable threshold given typical electrochemical measurement precision\n</ClaimCard>\n\n<VerbMapping>\n\"Increases\" \u2192 the voltage with Al-Mg alloy anode must be measurably higher than with pure Al anode. This is a comparative claim requiring a baseline (pure Al) and treatment (Al-Mg alloy) measurement.\n</VerbMapping>\n\n<MetricIntegrity>\nThe FoM is **battery voltage**, which in the context of an anode material specifically refers to the **anode potential** vs Li/Li\u207a reference. This is a well-defined electrochemical quantity. The voltage of a full battery depends on both anode and cathode potentials; the claim focuses on the anode contribution. We must evaluate the anode potential specifically, not full-cell voltage unless we can isolate the anode contribution.\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\n- **CALPHAD**: Can provide phase equilibria and thermodynamic data for Al-Mg alloys but does NOT directly compute electrochemical potentials or battery voltages. Not appropriate for this claim.\n- **CHGNet MLIP**: Can compute formation energies and structural properties but does NOT directly compute electrochemical potentials vs Li/Li\u207a. Not appropriate for this claim.\n- **Search tool**: Can find literature on Al-Mg alloy anodes, electrochemical potentials, and battery performance data. This is the appropriate tool.\n\n**Critical issue**: Neither computational tool directly represents electrochemical potentials or battery voltages. The claim is fundamentally about electrochemistry, not phase stability or mechanical properties.\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n- Units: Voltage (V), with typical anode potentials in the range of 0-2 V vs Li/Li\u207a\n- Baseline: Pure Al anode potential vs Li/Li\u207a is ~0.3-0.4 V (from electrochemical series)\n- Conversion: No unit conversion needed; voltage is reported directly in V\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\nSince this is a **universal claim** (\"alloying Mg increases voltage\"), a single well-documented counterexample (where Mg addition does NOT increase voltage or decreases it) would refute the claim. Conversely, consistent evidence across multiple compositions showing voltage increase would support it.\n\n**Stop rule**: \n- If literature shows Mg alloying decreases or does not change Al anode potential \u2192 STOP, claim refuted\n- If literature consistently shows Mg alloying increases Al anode potential across compositions \u2192 claim supported\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n<ToolPlan>\nGiven that neither CALPHAD nor CHGNet can directly compute electrochemical potentials:\n\n**Plan**: Use search_tool to find:\n1. Electrochemical data on Al-Mg alloy anodes vs Li/Li\u207a\n2. Comparative studies of pure Al vs Al-Mg alloy anode potentials\n3. Fundamental electrochemical principles regarding Mg alloying effects on Al anode potential\n\n**Budget**: 1-2 search queries should suffice:\n- Query 1: Direct search for Al-Mg alloy anode electrochemical potential data\n- Query 2 (if needed): Search for fundamental principles of how Mg affects Al electrochemical behavior\n\n**Expected outcome**: Literature data showing whether Mg alloying increases, decreases, or has no effect on anode potential.\n</ToolPlan>\n\n## Initial Assessment\n\nBefore searching, let me consider the electrochemical fundamentals:\n- Al has a standard potential of ~-1.66 V vs SHE (~0.34 V vs Li/Li\u207a)\n- Mg has a standard potential of ~-2.37 V vs SHE (~-0.37 V vs Li/Li\u207a)\n- Mg is MORE electropositive (more negative potential) than Al\n\n**Electrochemical reasoning**: When a more electropositive element (Mg) is alloyed into a less electropositive element (Al), the alloy potential typically shifts toward the more electropositive component (becomes more negative vs Li/Li\u207a). This would DECREASE the voltage (make it more negative), not increase it.\n\nHowever, I must verify this with actual data rather than rely solely on this reasoning.

The sources discuss lithium-rich magnesium alloys and lithium-zinc alloys, which are different systems from what the claim addresses (Al-Mg alloy as anode material).\n\nLet me refine my search to be more specific about aluminum-magnesium alloys as anode materials and their electrochemical potentials. I need to find data comparing pure Al anodes with Al-Mg alloy anodes.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the fundamental electrochemical principle I noted earlier: Mg is more electropositive than Al (more negative standard potential). This suggests that alloying Mg into Al would likely shift the potential more negative (lower voltage vs Li/Li\u207a), which would contradict the claim.\n\nLet me search more specifically for Al-Mg anode materials and their voltage characteristics.",

When alloying a more electropositive element into a less electropositive element, the alloy potential typically shifts toward the more electropositive component.\n\n4. **Expected effect**: Al-Mg alloy potential should shift toward Mg's potential, meaning it would become LOWER (more negative) vs Li/Li\u207a compared to pure Al. This would DECREASE the anode voltage, not increase it.\n\n**Representation Gate Failure:**\n- CALPHAD: Cannot compute electrochemical potentials\n- CHGNet: Cannot compute electrochemical potentials  \n- Search: Exhausted without finding relevant data\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven that:\n1. The computational tools cannot represent the required FoM (electrochemical potential/voltage)\n2. The search tool found no relevant data on Al-Mg alloy anodes\n3. Fundamental electrochemical principles strongly suggest Mg alloying would DECREASE voltage (not increase it)\n\nI must conclude based on electrochemical first principles. The claim states that \"Alloying Mg into an Al anode increases the voltage of a lithium battery.\" Based on standard electrode potentials and the fact that Mg is more electropositive than Al, this claim is **electrochemically implausible**. Alloying Mg into Al should decrease the anode potential (make it more negative vs Li/Li\u207a), thereby decreasing the battery voltage, not increasing it.\n\n## Final Verdict\n\n**Claim**: Alloying Mg into an Al anode increases the voltage of a lithium battery.\n\n**Evaluation Type**: Universal claim (implies general effect)\n\n**Target FoM**: Anode potential vs Li/Li\u207a (V)\n\n**Evidence**: \n- Standard potential data: Al (+1.38 V vs Li/Li\u207a) > Mg (+0.67 V vs Li/Li\u207a)\n- Electrochemical principle: Alloying more electropositive element shifts potential negatively\n- No contradicting experimental data found\n\n**Synthesis**: The claim contradicts fundamental electrochemical principles. Mg has a lower (more negative) potential vs Li/Li\u207a than Al. Alloying Mg into Al would shift the alloy potential toward Mg's lower value, thereby decreasing the anode voltage, not increasing it.\n\n**Score**: **Highly Infeasible** - The claim contradicts established electrochemical principles regarding standard electrode potentials.\n\n**What would change the score**: Direct experimental measurements showing Al-Mg alloy anodes have higher potentials vs Li/Li\u207a than pure Al anodes, which would require explanation via non-ideal solution behavior or kinetic effects that override thermodynamic expectations.\n\nI should now call the finish tool to complete the task.",
