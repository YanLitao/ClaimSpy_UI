  "reasoning": "- Call: \u20131 (Partially Infeasible). As written, the claim implies that Mg alloying into an Al anode raises the anode potential vs Li/Li+ (or universally \u201cincreases battery voltage\u201d), but standard electrochemical trends indicate Mg is more reducing than Al, so Mg additions should shift the alloy\u2019s potential lower, not higher. The claim is also underspecified about cathode/operating conditions and whether \u201cvoltage\u201d refers to anode potential or full-cell voltage.\n- Claim decomposition:\n  - Entity: Al anode with Mg alloying (Al\u2013Mg alloy).\n  - Property: \u201cVoltage\u201d increase (ambiguous: anode potential vs Li/Li+, or full-cell output voltage).\n  - Conditions: Unspecified (composition, state of charge, electrolyte, temperature).\n  - Scope: General.\n- Minimal truths needed:\n  1) Mg must raise the relevant electrochemical potential of the Al-based anode vs Li/Li+ (if \u201cvoltage\u201d refers to anode potential), or\n  2) If \u201cvoltage\u201d means full-cell output at fixed cathode, then the anode potential would need to move more negative only if the claim intended higher cell voltage via lower anode potential. The claim does not specify this.\n- Evidence:\n  - Direct/principled: Standard potentials vs Li/Li+: Al \u2248 +1.38 V; Mg \u2248 +0.67 V. Mg is more electropositive (lower potential), so alloying tends to shift the alloy potential downward, not upward.\n  - No direct measurements of Al\u2013Mg alloy anode potentials were provided.\n- Why \u20131 and not \u20132:\n  - Not fundamentally impossible; a narrowed or rephrased claim (e.g., \u201cMg lowers anode potential, which can increase full-cell voltage vs a fixed cathode\u201d) could be true. The current claim\u2019s directionality and ambiguity likely make it wrong as stated, but not physically impossible.\n- Why not 0:\n  - Although underspecified, the dominant electrochemical trend provides a concrete reason to believe the claim as written (interpreted as increasing anode potential) is probably wrong.\n- Assumptions/limitations:\n  - Interprets \u201cincreases voltage\u201d as increasing anode potential; no condition-matched experimental data were found. Non-ideal interactions or specific microstructures could nuance the magnitude but are unlikely to reverse the direction broadly.",
