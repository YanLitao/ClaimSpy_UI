  "reasoning": "- Call: \u20132 (Infeasible) because low\u2011temperature VO2 adopts the monoclinic M1 phase with well\u2011established V\u2013V dimerization and tilted, distorted VO6 octahedra; this directly contradicts the claim of \u201cno distortions.\u201d\n- Claim decomposition (minima):\n  1) Low\u2011T phase of VO2 exists under ambient pressure. 2) VO6 octahedra in that phase are undistorted (uniform V\u2013O bonds; near\u2011ideal O\u2013V\u2013O angles) for all V sites.\n- Evidence mapping:\n  - Direct/authoritative: Literature consensus that below ~340 K VO2 is monoclinic M1 with pronounced octahedral distortions driven by V\u2013V pairing and tilt (responsible for the insulating state).\n  - Direct (provided modeling, condition\u2011matched): CHGNet T=0 K relaxations show large bond\u2011length dispersion and sizable angle deviations, consistent with M1 distortions.\n  - No aligned evidence supports undistorted octahedra at low T in stoichiometric VO2.\n- Why not other scores:\n  - Not \u20131: The contradiction is fundamental (the stable low\u2011T phase is intrinsically distorted), not a narrow range issue.\n  - Not 0: Conditions are clear (\u201clow temperatures\u201d \u2192 M1 at ambient), and evidence is decisive.\n  - Not +1/+2: The claim direction is opposite to established structure.\n- Assumptions/limits: Interprets \u201clow temperatures\u201d as below the metal\u2013insulator transition in stoichiometric VO2 at ambient pressure; excludes unusual stabilization routes or high pressure.",
