  "reasoning": "-2 (Infeasible) because at ~65 at.% Al in the binary Fe\u2013Al system the thermodynamically stable primary phase is an Al\u2011rich intermetallic (FeAl2 near 66.7 at.% Al, and/or Fe2Al5 at lower T), not a BCC-based Fe (B2 FeAl) primary; thus the claim\u2019s core microstructural premise is reversed relative to authoritative phase equilibria, making the downstream property assertion inapplicable.\n\nClaim decomposition (minima that must all hold):\n- At ~65 at.% Al, the primary phase is BCC Fe-based (B2) and Al2Fe is only a small secondary fraction.\n- That secondary Al2Fe increases strength without causing embrittlement of the primary BCC matrix.\n\nEvidence mapping:\n- Direct/authoritative phase evidence: Fe\u2013Al phase diagrams place 65\u201367 at.% Al in/near the FeAl2 field; B2 FeAl is not primary there. CALPHAD (COST507) corroborates majority FeAl2 or Fe2Al5 with minority B2 at both 298 K and 900 K.\n- Processing notes: Non-equilibrium routes may retain some B2, but still as a minority; no credible route yields B2 as the primary phase at ~65 at.% Al under stated/implicit conditions.\n- Mechanical property evidence: Not adjudicable because the asserted microstructure does not form as stated.\n\nWhy not other scores:\n- Not \u20131: The mismatch is fundamental (phase hierarchy inverted), not a narrow-range numerical miss.\n- Not 0: Multiple, aligned high-confidence sources (phase diagrams + CALPHAD) decisively contradict the claim as stated.\n- Not +1/+2: Core prerequisite (primary BCC at 65 at.% Al) fails.\n\nAssumptions/limits:\n- \u201cAbout 65 at.%\u201d interpreted as ~63\u201367 at.% Al; across this window, Al\u2011rich intermetallics remain primary at equilibrium. Metastable retention of B2 does not invert majority/minority fractions.",
