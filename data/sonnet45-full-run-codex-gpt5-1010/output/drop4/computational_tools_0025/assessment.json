      "text": "At 65 at.% Al in the binary Fe-Al system, CALPHAD calculations using the COST507 database show that at room temperature (298K), the primary phase is AL5FE2 (Fe\u2082Al\u2085) at 70.02% molar fraction, with BCC_B2 as a secondary phase at 29.98%. At elevated temperature (900K), AL2FE (FeAl\u2082) is the primary phase at 90.21%, with BCC_B2 at 9.79%. This directly contradicts the claim that BCC iron is the primary phase with small amounts of secondary Al\u2082Fe.",

At room temperature near 67 at.% Al, single-phase FeAl\u2082 is expected at equilibrium. This corroborates the CALPHAD findings that Al-rich intermetallics are the primary phases at this composition.",
