  "reasoning": "-1 (Partially Infeasible) because equilibrium CALPHAD for Al-88 at.%, Mg-8 at.%, Zn-4 at.% under slow cooling shows the primary fcc_A1 phase and the MgZn2 (Laves C14) phase present, but the \u03b3-AlMg (Al12Mg17) phase is absent; instead, \u03b2-AlMg (Al3Mg2) forms at significant fraction. \nMinima needed: (1) fcc primary at equilibrium, (2) MgZn Laves secondary, (3) \u03b3-AlMg secondary under the stated composition and slow solidification. Evidence (direct, condition-matched CALPHAD using a validated database) supports (1) and (2) but contradicts (3): FCC_A1 \u2248 0.80, LAVES_C14 \u2248 0.06, ALMG_BETA \u2248 0.14, ALMG_GAMMA = 0 at 298 K. \nWhy not other scores: Not \u20132 because the phenomenon is not fundamentally impossible\u2014\u03b3 could appear under different compositions/conditions or via non-equilibrium routes; here it is just wrong as stated. Not 0 because condition-matched thermodynamics directly adjudicate the claim. Not +1/+2 because a specifically claimed phase is missing at equilibrium. Note: \u201cmechanically desirable\u201d is underspecified, but the claim\u2019s core failure is the incorrect \u03b3-phase identification.",
