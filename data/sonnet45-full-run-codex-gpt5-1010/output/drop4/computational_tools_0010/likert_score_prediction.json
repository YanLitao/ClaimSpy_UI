  "reasoning": "- Call: \u20132 (Infeasible) because condition\u2011matched CALPHAD shows the initial lithiation of Al2Cu enters a three\u2011phase equilibrium (Al2Cu + ternary Al\u2011Cu\u2011Li + fcc Al\u2011rich solid solution), directly contradicting the claim of a two\u2011phase reaction.\n- Claim decomposition (minima):\n  1) System: Li reacting with AlCu (Al2Cu, \u03b8 phase).\n  2) Property: number of coexisting phases during the initial reaction.\n  3) Conditions: standard/ambient temperatures (implicitly), initial Li uptake.\n  4) Scope: universal (asserts exactly two phases).\n- Evidence:\n  - Direct, aligned: CALPHAD equilibria at 298 K and 400 K for early Li contents (\u22485\u201310 at% Li at Al:Cu = 2:1) yield three coexisting phases: Al2Cu (\u03b8), a ternary Al\u2011Cu\u2011Li phase, and FCC_A1. Consistent across temperatures.\n- Why not \u20131: Not a marginal range/numeric disagreement; it is a direct contradiction of the asserted two\u2011phase nature under standard conditions.\n- Why not 0: Evidence is condition\u2011matched, appropriate (phase equilibria via CALPHAD), and unambiguous on phase count.\n- Why not +1/+2: The main assertion fails (two phases vs observed three).\n- Assumptions/limitations: Assumes equilibrium behavior (standard for phase count claims); kinetics could transiently affect phases but the claim is stated generally without kinetic qualifiers; relies on a validated Al\u2011Cu\u2011Li CALPHAD database.",
