Threshold: clear phase-field evidence or tie-line crossing showing 2-phase coexistence.\n</ClaimCard>\n\n<VerbMapping>\n- \"is a two phase reaction\" \u2192 The initial lithiation of AlCu proceeds through a two-phase coexistence region (not single-phase solid solution, not three or more phases). This is a **phase-count assertion** testable via phase diagrams or equilibrium calculations at the relevant conditions.\n</VerbMapping>\n\n<MetricIntegrity>\n- **FoM**: Number of equilibrium phases during initial Li + AlCu reaction.\n- **Direct measurement**: CALPHAD phase equilibrium calculation at the relevant T and composition path can directly yield phase fractions and identities.\n- **Proxy risk**: If we only have structural or voltage data, inferring phase count may be indirect. Ideally, we use thermodynamic equilibrium calculations (CALPHAD) to determine phase assemblages.\n- **Integrity**: CALPHAD is well-suited to answer \"how many phases are present\" at given T, P, composition.\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\n- **CALPHAD**: Can model Li\u2013Al\u2013Cu ternary system if a suitable thermodynamic database exists. The tool should be able to compute phase equilibria along a lithiation path (increasing Li content in AlCu).\n- **CHGNet MLIP**: Primarily for kinetics/barriers; not ideal for counting equilibrium phases. Would be out-of-scope for this claim.\n- **Search**: Can provide context on Li\u2013Al\u2013Cu phase diagrams, known reaction pathways, and whether \"two phase\" is documented for Li + AlCu.\n- **Representation check**: CALPHAD is the natural fit. We must confirm the database covers Li\u2013Al\u2013Cu and can represent AlCu (likely Al\u2082Cu or other intermetallics) and lithiated phases.\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n- **Units**: Phase count is dimensionless. Phase fractions are molar or volume fractions (dimensionless or %).\n- **Baseline**: If we compute a known Li\u2013Al or Li\u2013Cu binary, we should reproduce literature phase diagrams (e.g., Li\u2013Al forms LiAl, Li\u2083Al\u2082, etc.; Li\u2013Cu forms various Li_xCu_y phases). This validates the database before trusting ternary predictions.\n- **Conversions**: None needed for phase count, but we should verify temperature units (K vs \u00b0C) and composition units (mole fraction, atomic %, wt%).\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n- **Claim point**: \"Initial reaction\" suggests the very beginning of lithiation\u2014likely low Li content added to AlCu.\n- **Test design**:\n  1. Identify the starting composition of AlCu (assume Al\u2082Cu or Al-Cu alloy; may need to test both if ambiguous).\n  2. Compute equilibrium phase assemblage at a representative temperature (e.g., 298 K for ambient, or 400\u2013500 K for typical battery operation) as Li is incrementally added.\n  3. Check the phase count in the initial lithiation region (e.g., Li/(Al+Cu) mole ratio from 0 to ~0.1 or until first phase transformation completes).\n  4. **Stop rule (universal claim)**: If we find a single-phase or three-phase region in the initial reaction, the claim is refuted. If we consistently find two phases, the claim is supported.\n  5. **Replicates/sweep**: Vary T slightly (e.g., 298 K, 400 K) to check robustness; vary AlCu stoichiometry if ambiguous (Al\u2082Cu vs AlCu).\n- **Independent corroboration**: Search for experimental Li\u2013Al\u2013Cu phase diagram data or in-situ studies of Li + AlCu reactions to triangulate.\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n---\n\n## Tool Plan\n\n<ToolPlan>\n**Primary tool**: CALPHAD (cost 5, 1 call allowed)\n- **Rationale**: The claim is about phase count during a reaction, which is a thermodynamic equilibrium question. CALPHAD directly computes phase assemblages.\n- **Execution**: \n  - Start with AlCu (assume Al\u2082Cu as a common intermetallic; if ambiguous, test Al-50at%Cu).\n  - Incrementally add Li and compute equilibrium phases at 298 K (ambient) or 400 K (battery-relevant).\n  - Record phase identities and fractions in the initial lithiation region.\n  - Check if the initial reaction shows exactly 2 phases.\n\n**Secondary tool**: search_tool (cost 3, up to 3 queries)\n- **Rationale**: \n  - Query 1: Search for \"Li AlCu phase diagram\" or \"lithiation of Al2Cu\" to find experimental/computational priors on phase evolution.\n  - Query 2 (if needed): Search for \"Li-Al-Cu ternary phase diagram\" to understand the phase space.\n  - Query 3 (if needed): Search for specific phases formed (e.g., \"Li Al Cu intermetallic phases\").\n- **Use sparingly**: Only if CALPHAD result is ambiguous or if we need to validate the database's predictions against known data.\n\n**Sequencing**:\n1. **Search first** (1 query) to quickly check if \"two phase reaction\" for Li + AlCu is a known/documented behavior. This may guide interpretation of CALPHAD results or reveal if the claim is well-established.\n2. **CALPHAD** to compute phase assemblage during initial lithiation.\n3. **Search again** (if needed) to cross-check CALPHAD predictions with experimental data.\n\n**Stop rules**:\n- If search reveals clear experimental evidence of single-phase or three-phase initial reaction \u2192 stop, claim refuted.\n- If CALPHAD shows two phases in initial region and search corroborates \u2192 stop, claim supported.\n- If CALPHAD shows \u22602 phases \u2192 stop, claim refuted (no need for further tools).\n</ToolPlan>\n\n---\n\n## Execution Plan\n\n**Step 1**: Conduct a targeted search to understand the Li\u2013AlCu reaction landscape and check if \"two phase\" is documented.\n\n**Step 2**: Use CALPHAD to compute phase equilibria during initial lithiation of AlCu.\n\n**Step 3**: Synthesize evidence and score.\n\nLet me start with a search query to gather context on the Li + AlCu reaction and whether the \"two phase\" nature is known.",

The threshold \u03b8 for this claim is exact: \"two phase\" means phase count = 2. The observed phase count = 3, which is a clear mismatch.
