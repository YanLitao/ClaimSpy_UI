This is a universal claim requiring that at every point in the cooling trajectory from 500K to 300K, the phase fraction either increases or remains constant, with net positive change exceeding \u03b8.\n</VerbMapping>\n\n<MetricIntegrity>\nThe FoM is **phase fraction** of the precipitate phase. CALPHAD directly computes equilibrium phase fractions at specified T and composition. This is an exact match\u2014no proxy needed. The challenge is identifying which phase in the output corresponds to \"Aluminum Silicon Carbide precipitates.\"\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\nCALPHAD tools can handle ternary Al-Si-C systems if the thermodynamic database includes these elements and their compounds (SiC, Al\u2084C\u2083, potential ternary phases). The composition Al\u2083\u2080Si\u2085\u2085C\u2081\u2085 (at.%) is Si-rich with substantial C content. I must verify:\n1. Does the database represent Al-Si-C ternary interactions?\n2. Are relevant carbide phases (SiC, Al\u2084C\u2083, potential ternary carbides) included?\n3. Can it compute equilibrium at 300-500K?\n\nIf the database lacks ternary Al-Si-C representation or key carbide phases, this becomes **Not Represented**.\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n- Phase fraction: dimensionless (0-1) or percentage (0-100%). CALPHAD typically outputs mole fraction or mass fraction; I'll work with mole fraction.\n- Temperature: Kelvin (K) as stated.\n- Composition: at.% as given (Al\u2083\u2080Si\u2085\u2085C\u2081\u2085).\n- **Baseline**: For Al-Si-C systems, SiC is a well-known stable phase. At high Si and C content, I expect SiC formation. A sanity check would be that SiC appears as a stable phase in this composition range.\n- **Round-trip check**: Ensure temperature inputs match outputs; verify composition sums to 100%.\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n**Test points**: Evaluate equilibrium phase fractions at:\n- 500K (upper bound)\n- 400K (midpoint)\n- 300K (lower bound)\n\nThis captures the trend. If phase fraction increases monotonically from 500K\u2192300K and the change exceeds \u03b8 (10% relative), the claim is supported.\n\n**Stop rules**:\n- If phase fraction **decreases** at any step, the universal claim is refuted \u2192 STOP.\n- If the precipitate phase is not represented in the database \u2192 **Not Represented** \u2192 STOP.\n- If phase fraction increases monotonically and \u0394 > \u03b8 \u2192 claim supported \u2192 STOP.\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n---\n\n## Tool Plan\n\n<ToolPlan>\n**Primary tool**: CALPHAD (cost 5, 1 call allowed)\n- **Why**: The claim is about equilibrium phase fractions vs. temperature in a ternary system\u2014this is CALPHAD's core strength.\n- **What**: Compute equilibrium at Al\u2083\u2080Si\u2085\u2085C\u2081\u2085 for T = 300K, 400K, 500K.

    "thought_1": "## Analysis of CALPHAD Results\n\nThe CALPHAD calculation has returned crucial information. Let me parse and evaluate it against the claim.\n\n### Evidence from CALPHAD\n\n**Stable phases at Al\u2083\u2080Si\u2085\u2085C\u2081\u2085 across 300K-500K:**\n1. DIAMOND_A4 (graphite/diamond structure): ~0.5286 mole fraction\n2. AL8SIC7 (ternary carbide): ~0.3429 mole fraction  \n3. FCC_A1 (Al-rich fcc solid solution): ~0.1286 mole fraction\n\n**Critical finding**: The report states \"A three-phase equilibrium persists across the temperature range with **nearly temperature-invariant phase fractions**.\"\n\n### Mapping to Claim\n\n**Claim**: \"The phase fraction of Aluminum Silicon Carbide precipitates in Al30Si55C15 increases with decreasing temperature from 500K to 300K\"\n\n**Identified precipitate phase**: AL8SIC7 is the only stable carbide phase in this system (SiC and Al\u2084C\u2083 are not stable). This ternary aluminum silicon carbide is the \"Aluminum Silicon Carbide precipitate\" referenced in the claim.\n\n**Phase fraction behavior**: The CALPHAD result explicitly states the phase fractions are \"**nearly temperature-invariant**\" across 300K-500K. The AL8SIC7 phase fraction remains at ~0.3429 (\u00b1negligible variation) across the entire temperature range.\n\n### Evaluation Against Threshold \u03b8\n\n- **Observed change**: Essentially zero (temperature-invariant)\n- **Required threshold \u03b8**: \u226510% relative change for significance\n- **Actual change**: < 1% (effectively zero)\n\nThe claim asserts a **universal monotonic increase** with decreasing temperature. The CALPHAD evidence shows **no significant change**\u2014the phase fraction is constant within computational precision.\n\n### Verdict\n\nThis is a **clear refutation** of the claim:\n1. The claim requires monotonic increase (universal quantifier)\n2. The evidence shows temperature-invariant behavior (zero change)\n3. Zero change fails to meet the \u03b8 \u2265 10% threshold by a large margin\n4. The evidence directly contradicts the claimed trend\n\n### Stop Rule Triggered\n\nThe universal claim is refuted by the temperature-invariant behavior. According to the guidelines: \"Universal claims: one well-matched counterexample suffices \u2192 stop.\"\n\nThe entire temperature range 300K-500K serves as a counterexample to the claimed increasing trend.\n\n## Synthesis and Scoring\n\n**Evidence quality**: \n- Direct CALPHAD calculation at exact composition and temperature range\n- Uses established COST507R.TDB database\n- Three-phase equilibrium is thermodynamically consistent\n- Result is unambiguous: temperature-invariant phase fractions\n\n**Scope match**: Perfect\n- Exact composition: Al\u2083\u2080Si\u2085\u2085C\u2081\u2085 \u2713\n- Exact temperature range: 300K-500K \u2713\n- Exact FoM: phase fraction \u2713\n- Identified precipitate: AL8SIC7 (ternary aluminum silicon carbide) \u2713\n\n**Confidence**: High. CALPHAD is the appropriate tool for equilibrium phase fraction calculations, and the result is definitive.\n\n**Score**: **Highly Infeasible (1/5)**\n\nThe claim asserts a temperature-dependent increase in phase fraction, but the computational evidence shows the phase fraction is temperature-invariant across the specified range. This is a direct contradiction with zero ambiguity.\n\n## Structured Report\n\n**1. Claim (verbatim)**: \"The phase fraction of Aluminum Silicon Carbide precipitates in Al30Si55C15 increases with decreasing temperature from 500K to 300K\"\n\n**2. Scope Lock**: \n- System: Al-Si-C ternary, composition Al\u2083\u2080Si\u2085\u2085C\u2081\u2085 (at.%)\n- Precipitate: Aluminum silicon carbide phase (identified as AL8SIC7)\n- Temperature range: 500K \u2192 300K (cooling)\n- Pressure: Ambient (101325 Pa)\n- FoM: Equilibrium phase fraction (mole fraction)\n\n**3. Evaluation Type**: Universal (monotonic increase across entire range)\n\n**4. Target FoM & Units**: Phase fraction (mole fraction, dimensionless 0-1)\n\n**5. Plan**: CALPHAD equilibrium calculation at 300K, 400K, 500K for Al\u2083\u2080Si\u2085\u2085C\u2081\u2085\n\n**6. Evidence Table**:\n| Temperature | AL8SIC7 Phase Fraction | Change from 500K | In-Scope |\n|-------------|------------------------|------------------|----------|\n| 500K        | ~0.3429                | baseline         | \u2713        |\n| 400K        | ~0.3429                | ~0%              | \u2713        |\n| 300K        | ~0.3429                | ~0%              | \u2713        |\n\n**7. Synthesis**: The ternary carbide AL8SIC7 maintains constant phase fraction (~34.29 mol%) across the entire 300K-500K range. The claimed monotonic increase is not observed; instead, the system exhibits temperature-invariant three-phase equilibrium.\n\n**8. Score & Rationale**: **Highly Infeasible (1/5)**. The claim requires phase fraction to increase with decreasing temperature (universal quantifier), but CALPHAD shows temperature-invariant behavior with zero change across 300K-500K. This fails to meet the \u03b8 \u2265 10% threshold and directly contradicts the claimed trend.\n\n**9. Sanity/Consistency Checks**:\n- \u2713 Composition sums to 100%: 30+55+15=100\n- \u2713 Temperature range matches claim: 300K-500K\n- \u2713 FoM matches claim: phase fraction\n- \u2713 Precipitate identified: AL8SIC7 is the only stable carbide\n- \u2713 Score-narrative agreement: temperature-invariant contradicts \"increases\"\n- \u2713 Three-phase equilibrium is thermodynamically consistent\n\n**10. What would change the score**: \n- Experimental measurements showing temperature-dependent phase fractions that contradict CALPHAD\n- Alternative thermodynamic database showing different temperature dependence\n- Evidence that kinetic effects (non-equilibrium) dominate in this temperature range, making equilibrium calculations inapplicable\n\nHowever, for equilibrium phase fractions (the natural interpretation of the claim), the CALPHAD result is definitive.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe claim is **refuted**. No additional tools are needed\u2014the CALPHAD evidence is clear, direct, and decisive.",
