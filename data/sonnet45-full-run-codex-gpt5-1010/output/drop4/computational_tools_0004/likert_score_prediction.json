  "reasoning": "- \u20132 (Infeasible) because condition-matched CALPHAD equilibrium calculations at the exact composition and temperature range show the Al\u2013Si\u2013C precipitate (AL8SIC7) phase fraction is essentially constant from 500 K to 300 K, directly contradicting the claimed monotonic increase.\n- Claim minima:\n  - Composition: Al30Si55C15; Temperature: 500\u2013300 K; Environment: (implicit) equilibrium bulk.\n  - Target phase: \u201cAluminum silicon carbide precipitates\u201d \u2192 AL8SIC7.\n  - Property: Phase fraction increases as temperature decreases (monotonic across the whole range).\n- Evidence mapping:\n  - Direct (matched): CALPHAD (COST507R.TDB) yields stable phases DIAMOND_A4 (~52.9%), AL8SIC7 (~34.3%), FCC_A1 (~12.9%); AL8SIC7 fraction is nearly temperature-invariant with <1% change over 300\u2013500 K.\n  - No supporting evidence for an increasing trend; no contradictions to the CALPHAD within the provided scope.\n- Why not \u20131: Not a minor range/number mismatch; the universal monotonic increase is refuted by flat behavior across the entire stated range.\n- Why not 0 or +1/+2: Evidence is aligned and decisive against the claim; this is not an underspecification or partial support case.\n- Assumptions/limits: Equilibrium interpretation is standard for phase fraction unless non-equilibrium processing is specified. Results depend on the chosen thermodynamic database; alternative databases or kinetic effects could alter details but would need to show a sustained increasing trend across 500\u2013300 K to rescue the claim as stated.",
