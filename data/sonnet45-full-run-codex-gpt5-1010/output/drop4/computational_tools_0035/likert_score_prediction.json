  "reasoning": "- Call: \u20131 (Partially Infeasible). Direct, condition-matched experiments on Al\u2013Mg solid solutions show the elastic modulus does not increase and often decreases slightly; thus the claim of a significant increase within the primary Al phase is likely wrong as stated.\n- Decomposition (minima): (1) Mg dissolves in primary fcc-Al up to its solubility; (2) assessment is confined to the primary phase (no precipitates); (3) dissolved Mg significantly increases E (\u2265 about 5%) of the primary phase across relevant soluble concentrations.\n- Evidence:\n  - Direct experimental: 5052 (\u22482\u20132.5 at% Mg) shows E \u2248 69.3 GPa vs pure Al \u2248 70 GPa (no increase; slight decrease within uncertainty). Noble et al. (1982) report ~2 GPa decrease at ~4.5 at% Mg. Handbooks generally report E \u2248 69\u201371 GPa for Al and 5xxx alloys, with minimal dependence on Mg content.\n  - Mechanistic plausibility: Mg has lower E (~45 GPa) than Al (~69\u201370 GPa); in substitutional solid solution, stiffness increases are not expected, and observed trends are flat to slightly negative.\n- Why not 0: Multiple matched counterexamples directly contradict the claimed increase; not merely insufficient evidence.\n- Why not +1/+2: The required direction (\u201csignificant increase\u201d) is not supported anywhere in the soluble Mg range; observed trend is opposite or negligible.\n- Why not \u20132: This is not a fundamental impossibility but an empirical trend contradiction; narrowing the claim (e.g., \u201cno significant change\u201d) would remove the conflict.",
