  "reasoning": "-1 (Partially Infeasible) because while small fractions of FeAl2 (Al2Fe) are thermodynamically plausible on the Al\u2011rich side of FeAl near 50\u201352 at.% Al (and could raise strength), the claim\u2019s key assertion \u201cwithout causing embrittlement\u201d contradicts well\u2011established behavior: binary Fe\u201150Al is notoriously brittle at room temperature. Thus, as stated (under standard/implicit ambient conditions), the claim is probably wrong.\n\nClaim decomposition (minima):\n1) At 50\u201352 at.% Al, a secondary FeAl2 phase forms in small amounts and increases with Al content. \n2) This secondary phase increases mechanical strength. \n3) Its presence does not cause embrittlement.\n\nEvidence:\n- Direct/thermodynamic: Fe\u2013Al phase diagrams/CALPHAD place Al\u2011rich B2 FeAl in a two\u2011phase field with FeAl2 at lower T; FeAl2 fraction increases with Al content toward FeAl2 (supports 1).\n- Direct mechanical contradiction: Literature (e.g., NASA/peer\u2011reviewed reports) shows stoichiometric Fe\u201150Al exhibits totally brittle behavior at room temperature; FeAl2 is itself a hard, brittle intermetallic (contradicts 3; casts doubt on 2 for ambient ductility).\n\nWhy not \u20132:\n- Not a fundamental impossibility; with narrowed conditions (elevated temperature above FeAl\u2019s DBTT, or special processing), \u201cno embrittlement\u201d could be mitigated.\n\nWhy not 0/+1/+2:\n- Clear, condition\u2011matched negative evidence on embrittlement at ambient rules out neutrality or feasibility.\n\nAssumptions/limits:\n- Interprets unstated conditions as ambient mechanical behavior; microstructural/processing routes not specified.",
