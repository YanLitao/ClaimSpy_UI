  "reasoning": "- Call: \u20132 (Infeasible) because both established III\u2013V chemistry and direct computed formation energies show N strongly prefers the As (group V) sublattice in GaAs; the claim asserts the opposite.\n- Claim decomposition (minima that must hold): At STP in GaAs, substitutional N on Ga sites must have lower formation energy than on As sites (E_f(N_Ga) < E_f(N_As)).\n- Evidence:\n  - Direct (condition\u2011matched comparative energetics): CHGNet MLIP yields E_f(N_Ga) = 2.722 eV and E_f(N_As) = 0.936 eV, so \u0394E_f = +1.786 eV (N_Ga higher), decisively indicating N_As is more stable.\n  - Mechanistic/chemical rationale: N is a group V element, isovalent with As; substituting on the As (anion) sublattice preserves charge balance. N on Ga (cation) introduces severe charge/size mismatch, known to be energetically unfavorable.\n  - Literature consensus (indirect): Dilute nitride GaAsN is universally described as N occupying the As sublattice; N_Ga is not reported as the preferred site at ambient conditions.\n- Why \u20132 (and not \u20131/0/+1/+2):\n  - Not \u20131: The claim is directionally reversed relative to robust site preference, not just off in magnitude or range.\n  - Not 0: Multiple aligned lines (modeling + chemistry + literature practice) point against the claim; uncertainty is low.\n  - Not +1/+2: They would require evidence supporting N_Ga being more stable, which is contradicted.\n- Assumptions/limitations: Defect energetics can depend on chemical potentials and Fermi level/charge states; however, the large ~1.8 eV stability gap and isovalent rationale make a reversal at STP implausible.",
