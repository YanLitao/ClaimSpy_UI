  "reasoning": "- Call: \u20131 (Partially Infeasible) because the claim overgeneralizes a trend that appears to hold only for very small c-axis expansions; larger expansions destabilize the structure and degrade Cu\u2013O octahedral coordination.\n- Claim decomposition (minima that must all hold):\n  1) Cu\u2013O octahedral coordination in La2CuO4 is preserved under the manipulated c-axis spacing.\n  2) Increasing c-axis spacing monotonically stabilizes (lowers energy of) the octahedral state over some meaningful range, as implied by the unqualified wording.\n  3) Conditions/composition/phase remain consistent with La2CuO4 at ambient.\n- Evidence mapping:\n  \u2022 Direct (matching conditions, CHGNet relaxations): Small expansion (~+2%) reported as slightly stabilizing, but +5% and +10% clearly destabilize (energy increases), and apical Cu\u2013O bonds are >3.8 \u00c5 across cases, indicating loss of proper octahedral coordination.  \n  \u2022 Indirect (literature, Jahn\u2013Teller physics): Moderate axial elongation of Cu(II) octahedra can be energetically favorable; excessive elongation breaks apical coordination\u2014consistent with the observed non-monotonic behavior.\n  \u2022 Contradictions: The universal/monotonic implication (\u201cincreasing spacing stabilizes\u201d) fails beyond a narrow window; structural integrity of the octahedron is not maintained in the reported relaxations.\n- Why not other scores:\n  \u2022 \u20132: Not fundamentally impossible\u2014there is plausible, narrow-window stabilization at small expansion.  \n  \u2022 0: Evidence is not merely insufficient; it leans against the claim as written (non-monotonic trend, octahedral degradation).  \n  \u2022 +1/+2: The claim\u2019s generality is contradicted; octahedral preservation is not demonstrated and larger expansions destabilize.\n- Assumptions/limitations: \u201cStabilizes\u201d interpreted as lower energy with preserved octahedral coordination; MLIP (CHGNet) may overestimate distortions\u2014DFT+U/hybrid or experiment could refine bounds, but current aligned evidence argues against the unqualified claim.",
