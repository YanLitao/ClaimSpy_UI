For significance, I'll use: if the computed barrier is \u22650.1 eV (within method uncertainty ~0.02-0.05 eV for MLIP), the claim is refuted. If barrier <0.1 eV beyond uncertainty, claim is supported.\n</ClaimCard>\n\n<VerbMapping>\n\"The barrier is <0.1 eV\" \u2192 The activation energy for Li migration between adjacent sites must be strictly less than 0.1 eV. This is a quantitative threshold claim. A single well-characterized hop with barrier \u22650.1 eV would refute the universal claim.\n</VerbMapping>\n\n<MetricIntegrity>\nThe FoM is the **migration barrier** (E_barrier = E_max - E_initial for forward hop). This is directly accessible via NEB calculations using CHGNet MLIP. No proxy is needed; the tool can compute the exact FoM.\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\nCHGNet MLIP is trained on materials data including Li-ion battery materials and can represent:\n- Graphite (layered carbon structure)\n- Li intercalation in graphite\n- Energy landscapes for Li diffusion\n\nThe tool can perform NEB calculations to find migration barriers. This is well within scope. CALPHAD is not appropriate here (this is a kinetic barrier, not thermodynamic stability).\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n- Units: eV (electronvolts) for energy barriers. No conversion needed.\n- Baseline: Literature reports Li migration barriers in graphite typically in the range 0.2-0.6 eV (depending on pathway and concentration). Some reports suggest lower barriers (~0.1-0.3 eV) for in-plane diffusion in dilute limit. The claim of <0.1 eV is at the very low end and would need verification.\n- I will check if the computed barrier reproduces reasonable values and is consistent with the physical system.\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n**Test design:**\n1. Use CHGNet MLIP to compute the Li migration barrier in graphite\n2. Focus on the most common/relevant pathway: in-plane hopping between adjacent interstitial sites in the graphene layers (this is the dominant diffusion mechanism)\n3. Use a representative structure (e.g., LiC\u2086 or dilute Li in graphite)\n4. Compute the NEB pathway and extract the barrier\n5. **Stop rule**: If barrier \u22650.1 eV (accounting for method uncertainty), the universal claim is refuted \u2192 STOP. If barrier <0.1 eV, claim is supported.\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n<ToolPlan>\n**Plan:**\n1. **CHGNet MLIP (cost 7, 1 call)**: Compute Li migration barrier in graphite using NEB\n   - This directly measures the FoM (migration barrier in eV)\n   - The tool can represent the system and phenomenon\n   - One call should be sufficient for a decisive answer\n   \n2. **Search tool (cost 3, up to 3 calls)**: Use only if needed\n   - If CHGNet result is ambiguous or needs context (e.g., to compare with literature ranges)\n   - To verify that the pathway tested is the relevant one\n   - To check if <0.1 eV is physically reasonable\n   \n**Sequencing:**\n- Start with CHGNet MLIP since it directly computes the FoM\n- The claim is universal, so one well-characterized barrier \u22650.1 eV refutes it\n- If CHGNet gives a clear answer (barrier significantly above or below 0.1 eV), STOP\n- Only use search if the result is borderline or needs validation\n\n**Why not CALPHAD?** This is a kinetic barrier question, not thermodynamic stability. CALPHAD cannot compute migration barriers.\n\n**Cost consideration:** CHGNet (cost 7) is expensive but necessary and sufficient. Avoid search unless truly needed for context.\n</ToolPlan>\n\nNow I'll proceed with the CHGNet MLIP calculation to directly measure the Li migration barrier in graphite.",
