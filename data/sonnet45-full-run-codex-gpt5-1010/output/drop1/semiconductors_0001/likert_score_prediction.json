  "reasoning": "- \u20132 (Infeasible) because a single\u2011junction CIGS cell delivering 1.5 V Voc contradicts established photovoltaic limits for this material system and is far beyond certified records, with no supporting evidence.\n- Claim decomposition and minima:\n  1) Device is single\u2011junction CIGS (Cu(In,Ga)Se2), 2) Operates at Voc \u2265 1.5 V under standard 1\u2011sun conditions, 3) Existence is demonstrated and certified/measured.\n- Evidence mapping:\n  - Direct/authoritative: Certified single\u2011junction CIGS records report Voc well below 1.5 V (typ. ~0.6\u20130.8 V; recent record ~0.64 V for narrow\u2011Eg). No reports of \u22651.5 V.\n  - Physics/constraints: CIGS bandgap tunable ~1.0\u20131.7 eV, but persistent Voc deficits (~0.3\u20130.6 eV) preclude 1.5 V; even with Eg ~1.7 eV, a \u22640.2 V deficit needed for 1.5 V has not been observed in CIGS. Thus the stated number is beyond known achievable behavior.\n  - Contradictions: No literature instance; magnitude exceeds state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art by >2\u00d7.\n- Why not other scores:\n  - Not +1/+2: No supportive instance; conflicts with records and known deficits.\n  - Not 0: Conditions and FoM are clear; evidence weighs decisively against.\n  - \u20131 vs \u20132: The number is not just optimistic; it requires an unobserved, effectively inaccessible recombination regime for CIGS under 1\u2011sun, contradicting established behavior \u2192 \u20132.\n- Assumptions/limits: Standard test conditions; excludes series\u2011connected cells/modules and tandems (which could reach \u22651.5 V but are outside the claim).",
