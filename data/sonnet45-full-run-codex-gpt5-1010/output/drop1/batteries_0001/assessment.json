Since the launch of lithium-ion batteries, elements (such as silicon, tin, or aluminum) that can be alloyed with lithium have been expected as anode materials, owing to larger capacity. However, their successful application has not been accomplished because of drastic structural degradation caused by cyclic large volume change during battery reactions."

      "citation": "Alloying anodes face challenges to adoption, however, due to the large volume changes that typically accompany the alloying mechanism, changes that have negative consequences at multiple levels of the battery. At the anode particle level, repeated volume change can lead to the destruction and subsequent reformation of the SEI layer, which consumes both electrolyte and lithium. At the anode level, volume change can lead to the loss of electrical contact and pulverization of the active material, which results in capacity fade in the battery."

The literature confirms that alloying anodes undergo large volume changes (Al-Li alloying involves ~100% volume expansion). Established failure mode: Hard, brittle materials crack and pulverize under cyclic volume expansion, leading to rapid capacity fade. Literature consensus: Al alloying anodes have NOT been successfully implemented due to structural degradation from volume changes. The 'ultra-hard' + '>2000 cycles' combination is mechanistically contradictory for an alloying anode."
