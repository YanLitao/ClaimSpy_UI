  "reasoning": "- Call: \u20131 (Partially Infeasible) because, while 700 mAh/g is within Al\u2013Li theoretical capacity, there is no direct evidence of an Al\u2013Li alloying anode achieving >2000 cycles at room temperature, and the \u201cultra-hard\u201d requirement is mechanistically at odds with accommodating the large volume changes known to degrade Al\u2013Li anodes.\n- Minima that must all hold in the same system: (1) aluminum-based alloying anode; (2) \u201cultra-hard\u201d mechanical state; (3) room-temperature operation; (4) specific capacity \u2248700 mAh/g; (5) cycle life >2000 cycles with typical retention; (6) all simultaneously demonstrated.\n- Evidence mapping:\n  - Direct/matching: none found; targeted searches yielded zero reports of Al\u2013Li anodes with 700 mAh/g and >2000 cycles at RT.\n  - Authoritative/negative: literature notes Al alloying anodes suffer severe pulverization from large volume changes, preventing long cycle life; statements that successful durable Al alloying anodes have \u201cnot been accomplished.\u201d\n  - Mechanistic plausibility: \u201cUltra-hard\u201d typically implies high brittleness; under 100\u2013200% volumetric swings in Al\u2013Li alloying, such materials crack and lose electrical contact, contradicting long cycle life.\n- Why not \u20132: Not a fundamental thermodynamic impossibility; in principle, exotic architectures or composites could partially decouple hardness from damage, and \u201cultra-hard\u201d is unquantified in the claim.\n- Why not 0: The claim is existential and specific; absence of any matched evidence plus well-established degradation behavior makes it probably wrong as stated.\n- Why not +1/+2: No direct supporting demonstration; metrics are unprecedented for Al alloying anodes; the \u201cultra-hard\u201d descriptor is misaligned with the strain accommodation needed for durability.",
