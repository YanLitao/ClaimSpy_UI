Thermodynamic stability (primary): Gibbs free energy relative to competing phases, \u0394G < 0 or on convex hull (eV/atom)\n  2. Superconductivity (secondary): Critical temperature Tc > 0 K (though \"superconductor\" label requires Tc verification)\n**Quantifier:** Existential (\"discovered\" implies \"can exist\" / \"there exists\")\n**Threshold \u03b8:** \n  - For stability: On or within ~25 meV/atom of convex hull (standard DFT tolerance for synthesizability)\n  - For \"novel\": Not previously reported in literature/databases\n  - For superconductivity: Tc > 0 K (though quantitative value matters for practical relevance)\n</ClaimCard>\n\n<VerbMapping>\n- **\"Thermodynamically-stable\"** \u2192 The A15 Zr\u2083Sb phase must lie on or very near (\u226425 meV/atom) the convex hull of the Zr-Sb system at atmospheric pressure. This is the formal stability criterion.\n- **\"novel\"** \u2192 Not previously characterized/reported. However, per task framing, I treat this as hypothetical and focus on **technical plausibility** only.\n- **\"discovered\"** \u2192 Existential claim; one valid instance suffices.\n- **\"superconductor\"** \u2192 Implies Tc > 0 K, though the claim doesn't specify a value. Verification would require electronic structure analysis or experimental data.\n- **\"at atmospheric pressure\"** \u2192 Standard conditions, P \u2248 0.1 MPa.\n</VerbMapping>\n\n<MetricIntegrity>\nThe claim has two core FoMs:\n1. **Thermodynamic stability** (primary, explicitly stated): Formation energy relative to convex hull\n2. **Superconductivity** (secondary, implied by \"superconductor\"): Tc > 0 K\n\nCALPHAD can directly address thermodynamic stability via phase equilibria and convex hull analysis. However, CALPHAD typically does not predict superconducting properties (Tc), which require electronic structure methods (BCS theory, electron-phonon coupling).\n\nIf CALPHAD shows the A15 phase is **unstable** (off convex hull), the claim fails regardless of superconductivity. If stable, I would need additional evidence for superconductivity, but that may be out of scope for available tools.\n\n**Decision:** Focus on thermodynamic stability first. If A15 Zr\u2083Sb is unstable, the claim is refuted. If stable, I assess whether superconductivity can be inferred or requires additional evidence.\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\n**CALPHAD:** Can represent Zr-Sb binary system and compute phase equilibria, including whether A15 structure is stable. Standard databases (e.g., SGTE, COST) may or may not include A15 Zr\u2083Sb explicitly, but CALPHAD can assess stability via convex hull construction.\n\n**CHGNet MLIP:** Primarily for kinetics/barriers; not directly suited for thermodynamic stability assessment. Could compute formation energies, but CALPHAD is more appropriate for phase stability.\n\n**Search tool:** Can find literature on Zr-Sb system, A15 phases, and superconductivity in Zr\u2083Sb.\n\n**Representation check:** CALPHAD is the appropriate tool for thermodynamic stability. I will verify whether the database includes A15 Zr\u2083Sb or can assess its stability relative to other phases.\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n**Units:**\n- Formation energy: eV/atom (standard DFT/CALPHAD output)\n- Distance from hull: eV/atom (\u0394H_hull or E_above_hull)\n- Temperature: K\n- Pressure: atm or GPa (1 atm = 0.101325 MPa \u2248 0 GPa for solid-state purposes)\n\n**Baseline:** \n- Known stable Zr-Sb phases (e.g., ZrSb\u2082, Zr\u2085Sb\u2083) should appear on convex hull with \u0394H_hull = 0.\n- If CALPHAD reproduces known stable phases, confidence in A15 Zr\u2083Sb assessment increases.\n\n**Conversions:** Standard; no complex unit transformations needed.\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n**Test set:**\n1. **CALPHAD run:** Compute Zr-Sb phase diagram at atmospheric pressure (0 GPa), focusing on Zr\u2083Sb composition (x_Sb = 0.25). Check:\n   - Whether A15 Zr\u2083Sb is on convex hull (\u0394H_hull \u2248 0)\n   - Competing phases at this composition\n   - Temperature range of stability (if any)\n\n2. **Stop rule (existential claim):**\n   - If A15 Zr\u2083Sb is on/near convex hull (\u226425 meV/atom), stability is confirmed \u2192 claim supported (modulo superconductivity verification).\n   - If A15 Zr\u2083Sb is far from hull (>25 meV/atom), stability is refuted \u2192 claim fails.\n\n3. **Superconductivity:** \n   - If stability is confirmed, search for literature on A15 superconductors and Zr\u2083Sb electronic properties.\n   - If no direct evidence, note that superconductivity is plausible for A15 phases (many are superconductors) but unverified here.\n\n**Budget consideration:**\n- CALPHAD: 1 call (cost 5) \u2192 decisive for stability\n- Search: 1-2 calls (cost 3 each) \u2192 for A15 superconductivity context and Zr\u2083Sb literature\n- Total cost: 5 + 3-6 = 8-11 (well within budget)\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n<ToolPlan>\n**Plan:**\n1. **CALPHAD (cost 5, 1 call):** Assess thermodynamic stability of A15 Zr\u2083Sb at atmospheric pressure. This is the decisive test for the primary claim aspect.\n   - If unstable (>25 meV/atom from hull) \u2192 claim refuted, STOP.\n   - If stable (\u226425 meV/atom from hull) \u2192 proceed to assess superconductivity.\n\n2. **Search (cost 3, 1-2 calls if needed):** \n   - If CALPHAD confirms stability, search for:\n     a) A15 phase superconductivity (general context: many A15 compounds are superconductors)\n     b) Zr\u2083Sb electronic/superconducting properties (matched-condition data)\n   - Use to triangulate plausibility of superconductivity claim.\n\n3. **Synthesis & Report:** Combine CALPHAD stability result with search findings to render verdict.\n\n**Rationale:** \n- Thermodynamic stability is the **necessary condition**; if it fails, the claim fails regardless of superconductivity.\n- CALPHAD is the most direct, appropriate tool for stability assessment.\n- Search provides context for superconductivity, which CALPHAD cannot address.\n- This plan is minimal and decisive: one computational tool + targeted search.\n</ToolPlan>\n\nNow I will execute the plan, starting with CALPHAD to assess thermodynamic stability.",

Synthesis\n\n**Thermodynamic Stability Assessment:**\n- CHGNet predicts A15 Zr\u2083Sb lies **exactly on the convex hull** (E_above_hull = 0.000 eV/atom), satisfying the \u226425 meV/atom stability criterion\n- A15 is predicted to be 6.79 meV/atom **lower in energy** than the experimentally observed Ni3P-type structure\n- This energy difference is very small and within typical MLIP uncertainty ranges (10-50 meV/atom)\n- **Critical tension:** Experimental literature reports only Ni3P-type Zr\u2083Sb, not A15\n- The near-degeneracy suggests possible polymorphism, with kinetic or entropic factors potentially favoring Ni3P in synthesis\n\n**Superconductivity Assessment:**\n- **No direct evidence** for superconductivity in either A15 or Ni3P Zr\u2083Sb\n- A15 structure **can** host superconductivity (V\u2083Si at 17K, Nb\u2083Ge at 23.2K)\n- Zr\u2083Sb fits the A\u2083B chemical pattern (Zr = transition metal, Sb = p-block element)\n- **However:** The A15 prototype Cr\u2083Si is non-superconducting, demonstrating structure alone is insufficient\n- Electronic structure calculations (electron-phonon coupling, density of states) would be required for verification\n\n**Model Dependency:**\n- Single computational source (CHGNet MLIP) for stability assessment\n- CALPHAD unavailable (Sb not in database)\n- No experimental confirmation of A15 phase\n- No independent computational verification (e.g., DFT)\n\n### 8. Score & Rationale\n\n**Score: CONDITIONAL / MODEL-DEPENDENT SUPPORT**\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe claim of \"thermodynamically-stable A15 Zr\u2083Sb\" is **supported by CHGNet calculations** showing E_above_hull = 0.000 eV/atom, which satisfies the \u226425 meV/atom stability threshold. However, this verdict is **conditional** on several factors:\n\n1. **Single computational source:** Only CHGNet MLIP was available; CALPHAD failed due to database limitations\n2. **Experimental contradiction:** Literature reports Ni3P-type Zr\u2083Sb as the observed phase, not A15\n3. **Small energy difference:** The 6.79 meV/atom advantage of A15 over Ni3P is within MLIP uncertainty\n4. **Superconductivity unverified:** No computational or experimental evidence for Tc > 0 K in Zr\u2083Sb\n\nPer \u00a74 guidelines: \"If budget limits preclude a second independent line, label Conditional rather than over-claim.\" The thermodynamic stability aspect receives computational support but lacks experimental validation. The superconductivity aspect remains plausible (based on A15 structure class) but entirely unverified.\n\n**Likert-style confidence:** 3/5 (Conditional support with significant caveats)\n\n### 9. Sanity/Consistency Checks\n\n\u2713 **Units round-trip:** eV/atom used consistently; no conversion errors  \n\u2713 **Baseline match:** CHGNet reproduced elemental references (Zr hcp, Sb A7)  \n\u2713 **Proxy disclosure:** No proxies used; direct FoM (E_above_hull) computed  \n\u2713 **Score-narrative agreement:** \"Conditional support\" aligns with single-source computational evidence contradicting experimental observations  \n\u2713 **Scope fidelity:** Evaluated exact claim conditions (atmospheric pressure, A15 structure, Zr\u2083Sb composition)  \n\u26a0 **Model dependency:** Clearly labeled throughout; CHGNet is sole computational source  \n\u26a0 **Experimental gap:** A15 phase not observed experimentally; Ni3P is known stable phase\n\n### 10. What Would Change the Score\n\n**To upgrade to STRONG SUPPORT:**\n- Independent DFT calculations confirming A15 on convex hull with similar energy advantage\n- Experimental synthesis and structural characterization of A15 Zr\u2083Sb\n- Measurement of superconducting Tc > 0 K in A15 phase\n- Phonon calculations showing dynamical stability of A15 structure\n\n**To downgrade to REFUTED:**\n- High-accuracy DFT showing A15 significantly above hull (>50 meV/atom)\n- Experimental evidence that A15 cannot be synthesized under any conditions\n- Theoretical proof that Zr\u2083Sb electronic structure precludes superconductivity\n\n**Most decisive next step:** High-convergence DFT calculations (VASP, Quantum ESPRESSO) comparing A15 vs Ni3P energetics with phonon stability analysis.",
  "answer": "**CONDITIONAL SUPPORT** (Confidence: 3/5)\n\nThe claim that A15 Zr\u2083Sb is thermodynamically stable at atmospheric pressure receives **computational support** from CHGNet MLIP calculations, which predict the A15 structure lies exactly on the convex hull (E_above_hull = 0.000 eV/atom, well within the 25 meV/atom stability threshold). The A15 phase is predicted to be 6.79 meV/atom lower in energy than the experimentally known Ni3P-type structure.\n\n**However, this verdict is conditional due to:**\n\n1. **Single computational source:** Only CHGNet available (CALPHAD lacked Sb in database); no independent DFT verification\n2. **Experimental contradiction:** Literature reports Ni3P-type Zr\u2083Sb as the observed stable phase, not A15\n3. **Small energy margin:** The 6.79 meV/atom difference is within typical MLIP uncertainty (10-50 meV/atom)\n4. **Superconductivity unverified:** No computational or experimental evidence for Tc > 0 K, though A15 structure class can host superconductivity (e.g., V\u2083Si at 17K)\n\nThe thermodynamic stability aspect is **model-dependent but plausible**; the superconductivity aspect is **structurally plausible but unverified**. Independent high-accuracy DFT calculations and experimental synthesis would be required to confirm or refute the claim definitively."
