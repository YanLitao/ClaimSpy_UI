  "reasoning": "- Call: \u20131 (Partially Infeasible) because the claim bundles (i) thermodynamic stability of an A15 polymorph of Zr3Sb at 1 atm, (ii) its experimental discovery, and (iii) superconductivity. The only support is a single MLIP prediction with a sub-10 meV/atom margin relative to the known Ni3P-type phase, while experiments report only Ni3P at ambient and there is no evidence of superconductivity or discovery.\n- Minima that must hold:\n  1) A15 Zr3Sb exists at atmospheric pressure and is the thermodynamically stable polymorph (on/at bottom of hull). \n  2) It has been experimentally discovered/identified in that phase. \n  3) It is superconducting (Tc > 0 K) under ambient pressure.\n- Evidence mapping:\n  \u2022 Direct support: none for A15 phase existence/discovery or superconductivity.  \n  \u2022 Indirect/proxy: CHGNet MLIP places A15 on the convex hull and slightly below Ni3P (\u22486.8 meV/atom), within typical model uncertainty.  \n  \u2022 Contradictions: Literature identifies Ni3P-type Zr3Sb as the ambient stable phase; no reports of A15 or superconductivity in Zr3Sb.\n- Why \u20131 (and not 0): There is a concrete reason to believe the claim as stated is probably wrong\u2014\u201cdiscovered\u201d and \u201csuperconductor\u201d have no supporting evidence, and thermodynamic \u201cstable A15\u201d conflicts with established ambient-phase reports (Ni3P). \n- Why not \u20132: No fundamental impossibility is shown; near-degeneracy suggests A15 could be metastable or accessible under special conditions, and A15 compounds can be superconducting.\n- Why not +1/+2: Critical elements (phase verification, thermodynamic dominance at ambient, and superconductivity) are unverified/contradicted.\n\nAssumptions/limitations: Relies on one MLIP; no high-accuracy DFT/CALPHAD or experimental confirmation; superconductivity requires direct measurement or validated EPC calculations.",
