  "reasoning": "- Call: \u20132 (Infeasible) because the universal comparative claim is fatally contradicted by well-established superconducting wire materials with much higher Tc than Cr3Si.\n- Claim decomposition:\n  - Entity: Cr3Si superconducting wires.\n  - Property: Operating temperature ~ critical temperature (Tc).\n  - Quantifier: Higher than all other known superconducting wires (universal).\n  - Conditions: Unspecified; implicitly standard for wire applications.\n- Necessary minima:\n  1) Cr3Si is superconducting as a wire material with some Tc.\n  2) Tc(Cr3Si) exceeds Tc of all other known superconducting wire materials.\n- Evidence/contradictions:\n  - Counterexamples (direct, well-established): YBCO (~92 K), BSCCO (~110 K), MgB2 (~39 K), Nb3Sn (~18 K), NbTi (~9\u201310 K) all have higher Tc than any reported for Cr3Si.\n  - Cr3Si (A15 chromium silicide) is not a practical superconductor; if superconducting at all, Tc \u226a 1 K, far below the above.\n- Why not \u20131/0/+1/+2:\n  - Not \u20131: The issue is fundamental and universal; multiple definitive counterexamples exist.\n  - Not 0: Evidence is unambiguous and aligned; no parameter ambiguity can rescue the claim as stated.\n  - Not +1/+2: The required superiority over all other wires is decisively false.",
