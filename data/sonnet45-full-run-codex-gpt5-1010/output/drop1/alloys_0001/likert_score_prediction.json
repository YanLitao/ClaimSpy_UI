  "reasoning": "0 (Cannot determine) because the claim is underspecified (no Fe content, temperature, environment, baseline, or metric) and there is no direct, condition-matched evidence for Sc-matrix alloys with Fe doping improving oxidation resistance. The literature the agent found pertains to the inverse configuration (Sc as a dopant in Fe- or Al-based alloys) and does not adjudicate the claim as stated. There is no fatal thermodynamic or mechanistic contradiction that would make the claim impossible, but also no aligned support to justify feasibility.\n\nClaim decomposition (minima that must hold):\n- A scandium-matrix alloy with Fe doping exists (composition/phase control).\n- Oxidation testing under matched conditions shows the Fe-doped Sc alloy has improved resistance vs. undoped Sc alloy.\n- Conditions (T, environment, time) and magnitude of improvement are defined and exceed noise.\n\nEvidence mapping:\n- Direct: None located for Sc-matrix + Fe doping oxidation data.\n- Indirect/proxy: Reports of Sc improving oxidation in Fe/Al matrices (inverse system); pure Sc oxidation behavior.\n- Contradictions: None fundamental under ambient/high-T oxidation; absence is not disproof.\n\nWhy not other scores:\n- Not +1/+2: No direct, condition-matched support and key conditions are missing.\n- Not \u20131: No concrete evidence indicating the claim is probably wrong under the stated (unspecified) conditions; issues raised are mostly economic/practical, not fatal.\n- Not \u20132: No fundamental impossibility or phase/pressure contradiction.\n\nAssumptions/limitations:\n- Economics/practicality were noted by the agent but are not used as feasibility gate here.\n- If narrow conditions or specific compositions were provided with data, the score could shift.",
