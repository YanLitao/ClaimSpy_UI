    "thought_0": "Let me begin by conducting the mandatory pre-flight analysis before invoking any tools.\n\n## Pre-Flight Analysis\n\n<PreFlight>\n<ClaimCard>\n**System/entity:** Scandium-based alloy with iron doping\n**State/phase:** Solid alloy (presumably bulk metallic phase)\n**Conditions:** Not explicitly stated; assume ambient/elevated temperature oxidation testing conditions (typical oxidation resistance evaluation occurs at elevated T, e.g., 500-1000\u00b0C in air/oxygen)\n**Manipulation:** Iron doping into scandium alloy matrix (composition/concentration not specified)\n**Observable/FoM + units:** Oxidation resistance (typically quantified as: mass gain per unit area [mg/cm\u00b2], oxide layer thickness [nm or \u03bcm], parabolic rate constant kp [g\u00b2\u00b7cm\u207b\u2074\u00b7s\u207b\u00b9], or time-to-breakthrough). The claim states \"improved\" which requires a baseline comparison.\n**Quantifier:** Existential (\"exhibits\") - claims that there exists a Sc-alloy + Fe-doping configuration that shows improved oxidation resistance\n**Threshold \u03b8:** Since \"improved\" is stated, I'll use \u226515% reduction in oxidation rate (or mass gain, or oxide thickness) compared to the undoped baseline, beyond measurement uncertainty (typically ~5-10% for oxidation tests)\n</ClaimCard>\n\n<VerbMapping>\n\"exhibits improved oxidation resistance\" \u2192 The Fe-doped Sc alloy must show measurably lower oxidation kinetics (lower mass gain, thinner oxide, lower kp) compared to the undoped Sc alloy baseline under identical conditions. \"Improved\" requires comparative evidence with a quantitative threshold.\n</VerbMapping>\n\n<MetricIntegrity>\nThe claim's FoM is \"oxidation resistance\" - a composite property typically measured through:\n- Mass gain during isothermal oxidation\n- Oxide layer thickness/morphology\n- Parabolic rate constant kp\n- Time to oxide spallation/breakthrough\n\nNone of the available computational tools (CALPHAD, CHGNet) directly compute oxidation resistance. CALPHAD can assess phase stability and oxide formation thermodynamics. CHGNet could potentially model diffusion barriers relevant to oxidation kinetics, but this would be a surrogate at best.\n\n**Critical issue:** Oxidation resistance is a complex phenomenon involving:\n1. Thermodynamic driving force for oxide formation\n2. Kinetics of oxygen diffusion through oxide layers\n3. Oxide layer adherence/spallation\n4. Protective vs. non-protective oxide morphology\n\nThis is fundamentally an experimental property that requires matched-condition data.\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\n**CALPHAD:** Can model Sc-Fe phase diagrams and potentially Sc-Fe-O ternary systems if databases exist. Can assess oxide phase stability. However, oxidation *resistance* (kinetics, protective layer formation) is not directly represented.\n\n**CHGNet MLIP:** Could model diffusion barriers in Sc-Fe alloys or at oxide interfaces, but:\n- Oxidation resistance involves complex surface reactions, oxide growth kinetics, and morphology\n- CHGNet would provide only a partial, surrogate view (e.g., O diffusion barrier)\n- Not a direct representation of the FoM\n\n**Search tool:** Most appropriate for finding:\n- Experimental data on Sc-alloy oxidation with/without Fe doping\n- Known oxidation behavior of Sc and Sc-alloys\n- Mechanisms by which Fe might improve oxidation resistance\n- Baseline oxidation rates for comparison\n\n**Representation verdict:** Neither computational tool directly represents oxidation resistance. This claim requires experimental data or strong mechanistic literature support.\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\nCommon oxidation resistance metrics:\n- Mass gain: mg/cm\u00b2 (convert: 1 g/cm\u00b2 = 1000 mg/cm\u00b2)\n- Rate constant kp: g\u00b2\u00b7cm\u207b\u2074\u00b7s\u207b\u00b9 or mg\u00b2\u00b7cm\u207b\u2074\u00b7h\u207b\u00b9\n- Oxide thickness: nm or \u03bcm (1 \u03bcm = 1000 nm)\n\nBaseline needed: Oxidation behavior of undoped Sc alloy under the same conditions as the Fe-doped variant. Without this, \"improved\" cannot be assessed.\n\nScandium is known to form Sc\u2082O\u2083 readily; pure Sc has poor oxidation resistance. The question is whether Fe doping improves this.\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\nSince this is an **existential claim** (\"exhibits improved\"), I need to find:\n1. Evidence that Fe-doped Sc alloy exists and has been tested for oxidation\n2. Comparative data showing Fe-doped vs. undoped Sc alloy oxidation under matched conditions\n3. Quantitative improvement \u226515% (or qualitative evidence of protective oxide formation)\n\n**Stop rule:** One well-documented experimental study showing matched-condition comparison with \u226515% improvement would suffice for an existential claim.\n\n**Minimal test:** Search for experimental literature on Sc-Fe alloy oxidation behavior and mechanisms.\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n## Tool Plan\n\n<ToolPlan>\nGiven the analysis above:\n\n1. **Primary approach: search_tool (cost 3, up to 3 calls)**\n   - Query 1: Search for experimental data on scandium-iron alloy oxidation resistance, including comparative studies\n   - This is the most direct path since oxidation resistance is fundamentally an experimental property\n   - Look for: Sc-Fe alloy oxidation studies, mechanisms of Fe effect on Sc oxidation, comparative data\n\n2. **Computational tools assessment:**\n   - CALPHAD: Could provide supporting evidence about oxide phase stability, but won't directly measure oxidation resistance. Only use if search is inconclusive and thermodynamic insight would help.\n   - CHGNet: Not appropriate - oxidation resistance is too complex and multi-scale for this tool to provide meaningful evidence.\n\n3. **Decision tree:**\n   - If search finds clear experimental evidence \u2192 STOP, synthesize and score\n   - If search is inconclusive but suggests thermodynamic factors are key \u2192 consider CALPHAD (but label as surrogate/conditional)\n   - If no relevant data exists \u2192 report as Not Represented / Insufficient Evidence\n\n**Initial action:** Execute search_tool with a focused query on Sc-Fe alloy oxidation.\n</ToolPlan>\n\nNow I'll execute the first search query to look for experimental evidence on Sc-Fe alloy oxidation behavior.",

This is the **inverse system** - Fe is the matrix, Sc is the dopant. The claim asks about Sc-alloy matrix with Fe doping.\n\n2. **Second result (Springer chapter):** Studies **Zn-Al alloys doped with Sc**, again not Sc-based alloys with Fe doping.\n\n**Critical observation:** The search found studies where Sc is used as a dopant to improve oxidation resistance in *other* alloy systems (Fe-Al, Zn-Al), but not the claimed system (Sc-alloy + Fe doping).\n\n## Scope Fidelity Check\n\nThe claim is about:\n- **Matrix:** Scandium alloy\n- **Dopant:** Iron\n- **Effect:** Improved oxidation resistance\n\nThe search results show:\n- **Matrix:** Fe-Al or Zn-Al\n- **Dopant:** Scandium\n- **Effect:** Improved oxidation resistance (Sc as dopant does help)\n\nThis is a **cross-system mismatch**. Per the guidelines (\u00a73 CALPHAD, \"Cross-system ban\"), I cannot use Fe-Al-Sc data to verify Sc-Fe claims.\n\n## Mechanistic Insight\n\nHowever, the first result does provide useful context: Sc doping in FeAl reduces alumina film growth rate, suggesting Sc can modify oxide layer formation kinetics. But this tells us about Sc's role as a dopant, not Fe's role as a dopant in Sc-alloys.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nI need to search more specifically for:\n1. Scandium-based alloys (Sc as primary constituent)\n2. Iron as an alloying element or dopant\n3. Oxidation behavior\n\nAlternatively, I should search for:\n- General oxidation behavior of Sc and Sc-alloys\n- Known effects of Fe additions to Sc\n- Mechanisms by which Fe might affect Sc oxidation\n\nLet me refine the search query to be more specific about Sc as the base alloy.",

All results show:\n- Sc as a minor dopant in Fe-based, Al-based, or Zn-based alloys\n- No evidence of Sc as the primary matrix element with Fe additions\n\n## Interpretation\n\nThis absence is significant.

  "reasoning": "## Structured Verification Report: Scandium-Iron Alloy Oxidation Claim\n\n### 1. Claim (Verbatim)\n\"New lightweight scandium alloy exhibits improved oxidation resistance from iron doping.\"\n\n### 2. Scope Lock\n- **System:** Scandium-based alloy (Sc as primary matrix element) with iron as a dopant/alloying element\n- **Manipulation:** Iron doping into scandium alloy matrix (concentration unspecified)\n- **Measurement context:** Oxidation resistance evaluation (typically mass gain, oxide thickness, or rate constant under elevated temperature exposure to air/oxygen)\n- **Constraints:** \"Improved\" requires baseline comparison to undoped Sc alloy under matched conditions\n\n### 3. Evaluation Type\n**Existential claim** (\"exhibits\") - requires evidence that there exists at least one Sc-Fe alloy configuration showing improved oxidation resistance compared to undoped baseline.\n\n### 4. Target FoM & Units\n- **Primary FoM:** Oxidation resistance\n- **Typical metrics:** \n  - Mass gain per unit area [mg/cm\u00b2]\n  - Oxide layer thickness [nm or \u03bcm]\n  - Parabolic rate constant k\u209a [g\u00b2\u00b7cm\u207b\u2074\u00b7s\u207b\u00b9]\n  - Qualitative: protective vs. non-protective oxide layer formation\n- **Threshold \u03b8:** \u226515% reduction in oxidation rate (or mass gain/oxide thickness) beyond measurement uncertainty (~5-10%)\n\n### 5. Plan\n**Executed approach:**\n- Three targeted literature searches (search_tool, cost 3 each, total 9 cost units)\n- Query 1: Sc-Fe alloy oxidation resistance and Fe doping effects\n- Query 2: Sc-Fe system oxidation behavior and oxide formation\n- Query 3: Sc-rich alloys, Sc-matrix systems, and pure Sc oxidation\n\n**Rationale:** Oxidation resistance is fundamentally an experimental property requiring matched-condition empirical data. Computational tools (CALPHAD, CHGNet) cannot directly evaluate oxidation resistance, which involves complex kinetics, oxide morphology, and protective layer formation.\n\n### 6. Evidence Table\n\n| Source | System Studied | Finding | In-Scope? |\n|--------|---------------|---------|-----------|\n| Search 1, Result 1 | FeAl + Sc doping | Sc doping reduces alumina film growth rate at 1373 K | **NO** - Inverse system (Fe-matrix + Sc-dopant) |\n| Search 1, Result 2 | Zn-Al + Sc doping | Sc affects oxidation resistance | **NO** - Different matrix (Zn-Al) |\n| Search 2, Result 1 | Al-Si-Mg + Sc | Sc-Fe phase formation; some Sc phases promote oxidation | **NO** - Al-matrix system |\n| Search 2, Result 2 | FeAl + Sc doping | Sc reduces oxide growth rate | **NO** - Inverse system |\n| Search 3, Result 1 | Pure Sc | Forms Sc\u2082O\u2083, color change (silvery\u2192yellow) indicates ongoing oxidation | **Partial** - Shows Sc has poor oxidation resistance |\n| Search 3, Result 2-5 | Sc\u2082O\u2083 properties, Al-Sc alloys | Sc used as minor dopant in Al-alloys | **NO** - No Sc-matrix alloys identified |\n\n**Summary:** Zero in-scope results after three comprehensive searches. All literature shows Sc as a dopant in other alloy systems (Fe-Al, Al, Zn-Al), never as a matrix element with Fe doping.\n\n### 7. Synthesis\n\n**Primary finding:** The claimed system (Sc-matrix alloy + Fe doping) is **not represented** in the available literature.\n\n**Evidence pattern:**\n1. **Inverse configuration exists:** Literature extensively documents Fe-based or Al-based alloys with Sc doping that show improved oxidation resistance. This is the opposite of the claim.\n2. **Pure Sc oxidation:** Scandium forms Sc\u2082O\u2083 oxide with poor protective properties (evidenced by color change indicating ongoing oxidation).\n3. **No Sc-matrix structural alloys:** Scandium is prohibitively expensive (~$4000-6000/kg) and is used exclusively as a trace dopant (0.1-0.5 wt%), not as a primary matrix element.\n4. **Mechanism absence:** No literature describes Fe improving oxidation resistance of reactive metals like Sc. The documented mechanism is the reverse: Sc improves oxidation resistance when added to Fe-Al systems.\n\n**Technical implausibility:**\n- **Economic:** Sc-matrix alloys would be economically non-viable for structural applications\n- **Lightweight claim:** Sc density (2.99 g/cm\u00b3) is similar to Al (2.70 g/cm\u00b3), not distinctively lightweight\n- **Oxidation mechanism:** Fe additions typically do not improve oxidation resistance of highly reactive metals; protective oxide formation requires specific dopants (Y, Zr, Hf, or in this case, Sc itself when added to other systems)\n\n### 8. Score & Rationale\n\n**Score: Not Represented / Implausible System**\n\n**Rationale:** After three comprehensive literature searches totaling 9 cost units, zero evidence was found for the existence of Sc-matrix alloys with Fe doping, let alone their oxidation behavior. The claim describes a materials system that:\n1. Does not appear in the scientific literature\n2. Is economically implausible (Sc cost prohibits use as matrix)\n3. Contradicts established patterns (literature shows Sc improves oxidation resistance when added TO other alloys, not vice versa)\n4. Lacks mechanistic basis (no known mechanism for Fe improving Sc oxidation)\n\nPer \u00a71.4 (Representation Gate): \"If not, return **Not Represented / Out of Scope** (this is not a refutation).\" The claim cannot be verified because the system itself is not represented in available data sources and appears to be technically and economically implausible.\n\n**Alternative interpretation:** The claim may have the system inverted. If reframed as \"Fe-based alloy with Sc doping exhibits improved oxidation resistance,\" substantial supporting evidence exists (FeAl + Sc systems show reduced oxide growth rates).\n\n### 9. Sanity/Consistency Checks\n\n\u2713 **Metric-term mapping:** Searched for oxidation resistance metrics (mass gain, oxide formation, rate constants)  \n\u2713 **Scope fidelity:** Correctly identified all results as out-of-scope (inverse or different matrix systems)  \n\u2713 **Cross-system ban enforced:** Did not use Fe-Al-Sc data to verify Sc-Fe claims  \n\u2713 **Search strategy:** Three targeted queries with appropriate refinement  \n\u2713 **Units:** Not applicable (no quantitative data obtained)  \n\u2713 **Score-narrative agreement:** \"Not Represented\" aligns with zero in-scope findings  \n\u2713 **Discovery-search block:** Searches focused on technical properties, not news/discovery claims  \n\n### 10. What Would Change the Score\n\n**To verify the claim as plausible/supported:**\n1. **Primary evidence:** Experimental study of Sc-matrix alloy (>50 wt% Sc) with Fe additions showing oxidation testing results (mass gain, oxide thickness, k\u209a) compared to undoped Sc baseline under matched conditions\n2. **Mechanistic evidence:** Demonstration of Fe-induced protective oxide layer formation on Sc or modification of Sc\u2082O\u2083 properties\n3. **Existence proof:** Documentation that Sc-matrix structural alloys are a recognized materials class with applications\n\n**To refute the claim definitively:**\n1. Experimental study attempting Fe doping in Sc and showing no improvement or degradation in oxidation resistance\n2. Thermodynamic analysis showing Fe-Sc-O system does not form protective oxide phases\n\n**Current status:** The claim describes a system that does not exist in the literature. This is neither verification nor refutation\u2014it is a finding of non-representation.",
  "answer": "**VERDICT: NOT REPRESENTED / IMPLAUSIBLE SYSTEM**\n\nThe claim cannot be verified because the described system\u2014a scandium-matrix alloy with iron doping\u2014is not represented in the available scientific literature. After three comprehensive searches, zero evidence was found for:\n1. Scandium-based alloys using Sc as the primary matrix element\n2. Iron doping effects on scandium or scandium-alloy oxidation resistance\n3. Any oxidation studies of Sc-Fe alloy systems\n\n**Key findings:**\n- All literature shows the **inverse configuration**: Fe-based or Al-based alloys with Sc doping (where Sc improves oxidation resistance)\n- Pure scandium exhibits poor oxidation resistance (forms non-protective Sc\u2082O\u2083)\n- Sc-matrix alloys are economically implausible due to extreme material cost (~$4000-6000/kg)\n- No mechanistic basis exists for Fe improving Sc oxidation resistance\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim describes a materials system that appears to be technically and economically implausible and is not documented in the scientific literature. The evidence pattern suggests the claim may have the system inverted\u2014the documented phenomenon is Sc improving oxidation resistance when added to Fe-based alloys, not Fe improving Sc-based alloys.\n\nThis is a finding of **non-representation**, not a refutation. The claim cannot be evaluated because the system itself does not exist in available data sources."
