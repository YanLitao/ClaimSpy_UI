  "reasoning": "+2 (Feasible) because multiple published demonstrations report working wire/fiber-shaped lithium-ion batteries made by coating anode and cathode wires with separator/electrolyte and twisting them together, satisfying ionic conduction and electronic isolation.\n- Minima: (i) two separate electrode wires exist (anode, cathode), (ii) separator/electrolyte prevents shorting while enabling ion transport, (iii) twisting the parallel wires yields a functional battery.\n- Direct evidence: reports of twisted-pair fiber batteries (e.g., CNT/Si fiber anode vs. cathode) where an all-solid or gel electrolyte/separator layer is deposited on the wires before twisting; devices operate as Li-ion batteries.\n- Mechanistic fit: geometry gives continuous ionic pathways and maintains electronic isolation via the coated separator; extensively used in flexible/wearable battery literature.\n- Why not +1/0/\u20131/\u20132: This is not speculative or range-limited; it has been directly realized under matching conditions, with no fundamental conflicts.",
