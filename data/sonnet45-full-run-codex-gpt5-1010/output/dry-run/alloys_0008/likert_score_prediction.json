  "reasoning": "- \u20131 (Partially Infeasible) because the claim hinges on a critical, likely incorrect mechanism (\u201cincrease the melting point\u201d via minor W additions) and overstates the outcome (\u201cprevent\u201d creep at 700\u00b0C), even though grain\u2011boundary pinning by W\u2011rich particles is plausible and fabrication by machining/forging is not impossible.\n- Minima that must hold:\n  1) AM162 can be shaped into a nozzle/bell by forging + machining. 2) W can be incorporated to form stable second phases. 3) W additions increase the bulk melting/solidus of AM162. 4) W\u2011containing phases pin grain boundaries at 700\u00b0C. 5) The result \u201cprevents\u201d creep at 700\u00b0C in service.\n- Evidence mapping:\n  - Fabrication: Machining AM162 is standard; forging is less common but not fundamentally impossible \u2192 indirect support.\n  - W incorporation: W is largely insoluble in Al/Be; likely forms stable second phases (e.g., W\u2011rich compounds) \u2192 supports pinning plausibility.\n  - Melting point increase: Minor, insoluble W additions are unlikely to raise the alloy\u2019s bulk liquidus/solidus; at best neutral or slight depression unless compositionally dominant phases form \u2192 contradicts the stated mechanism.\n  - Creep at 700\u00b0C: GB pinning can reduce GB sliding, but \u201cprevent\u201d is too strong at ~0.5\u20130.6 Tm; effect is mitigating, not eliminating \u2192 overclaim.\n- Why not \u20132: No clear fatal thermodynamic contradiction to operation below bulk solidus is established; GB pinning by W\u2011rich particles is mechanistically sound, and some parts of the claim (fabrication, pinning) could hold in a narrower sense.\n- Why not 0: There are concrete, evidence\u2011based reasons to view the \u201cincrease melting point\u201d and \u201cprevent creep\u201d parts as probably wrong, not merely unknown.\n- Why not +1/+2: The claim\u2019s core mechanism (raising melting point) is likely incorrect, and the scope (\u201cprevent\u201d creep at 700\u00b0C) is overstated without direct, condition\u2011matched data.\n\nAssumptions/limitations:\n- Assumes W additions are minor (typical for pinning). Specific phase equilibria and solidus for Al\u2011Be\u2011W not quantified here; however, general thermodynamics and insolubility trends are strong guides.",
