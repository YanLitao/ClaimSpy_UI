  "reasoning": "- Call: \u20132 (Infeasible) because a LiCoO2 cathode on a copper current collector cycled to 4.2 V violates fundamental electrochemical stability; Cu oxidizes/dissolves above ~3.5 V vs Li/Li+, making 96% retention over 300 cycles unattainable.\n- Minima that must all hold:\n  1) Copper as the cathode current collector must be stable up to 4.2 V vs Li/Li+.\n  2) The LiCoO2/graphite full cell must cycle between 2.7\u20134.2 V without collector degradation.\n  3) Capacity retention of 96% after 300 cycles must be achievable under these conditions.\n- Evidence mapping:\n  - Contradictory (decisive): Cu oxidizes/dissolves in Li-ion electrolytes at potentials \u22733.5 V vs Li/Li+; standard practice universally uses Al for cathodes precisely to avoid Cu dissolution at high voltage. At 4.2 V, Cu dissolution, loss of contact, Cu2+ contamination, and possible Cu plating on the anode are expected, leading to rapid capacity loss.\n  - Indirect/context: Properly built LiCoO2/graphite cells with Al collectors can achieve high retention at 4.2 V, but the cathode collector material is a fatal mismatch here.\n- Why not other scores:\n  - Not \u20131: The issue is fundamental (thermodynamic/electrochemical instability), not just a too-optimistic numeric range.\n  - Not 0: Conditions are explicit and directly contradict Cu stability; no key parameter is missing.\n  - Not +1/+2: A critical necessary condition (cathode collector stability) fails; performance cannot be realized.\n- Assumptions/limits: Assumes conventional Li-ion electrolytes and no extraordinary isolation/coating that would keep Cu out of high potential/electrolyte contact; such measures are neither standard nor stated in the claim.",
