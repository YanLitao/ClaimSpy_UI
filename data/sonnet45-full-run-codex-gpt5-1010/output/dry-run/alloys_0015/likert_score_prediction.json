  "reasoning": "+1 (Partially Feasible) because there is directional, condition-matched thermodynamic support that the Cu:Ta:Li = 2:6:1 composition can be single-phase at elevated temperatures, but this rests on model/database assumptions without experimental confirmation and with room\u2011temperature equilibrium predicting two phases.\n\n- Claim decomposition (minima that must hold):\n  1) Composition fixed at Cu:Ta:Li = 2:6:1 (\u224822.2:66.7:11.1 at.%).\n  2) Existence of at least one processing/temperature window where the alloy is single phase.\n  3) Synthesis access to that window (i.e., practically creatable).\n\n- Evidence mapping:\n  \u2022 Direct modeling (CALPHAD, pycalphad; COST 507 database): predicts 100% single-phase (BCC_B2) at \u2265500 K; two-phase at 298 K. This supports an existential claim that a single-phase region exists under some conditions.\n  \u2022 Limitations: outcome depends on database fidelity for Cu\u2013Ta\u2013Li ternary; equilibrium assumptions; no experimental verification provided.\n\n- Why not +2:\n  \u2022 No direct experimental confirmation (e.g., XRD/TEM) of a single phase at this composition.\n  \u2022 Model/database applicability and accuracy for this specific ternary are uncertain; predicted B2 at a markedly off\u2011equiatomic Ta content may be sensitive to assessment details.\n  \u2022 Room\u2011temperature equilibrium is two-phase, so achieving/retaining single phase likely requires specific thermal/kinetic control.\n\n- Why not 0 or \u20131:\n  \u2022 There is condition-aligned, albeit model-dependent, positive evidence for a single-phase region, consistent with the existential framing (\u201ccreated\u201d implies some processing window). This tilts the balance toward feasibility rather than indeterminacy or likely wrongness.\n\n- Assumptions/limitations:\n  \u2022 Accepts CALPHAD database coverage and ternary extrapolation quality as adequate.\n  \u2022 Assumes synthesis at elevated T (or appropriate kinetics) can access and quench/retain the single phase.\n  \u2022 No structural requirement specified in the claim; the feasibility call focuses on \u201csingle phase\u201d existence, not room\u2011temperature stability or specific crystal structure.",
