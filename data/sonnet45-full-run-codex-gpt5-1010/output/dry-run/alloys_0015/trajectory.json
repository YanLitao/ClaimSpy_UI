CALPHAD directly computes equilibrium phase fractions at specified T and composition. This is an exact match\u2014no proxy needed.\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\nMust verify:\n1. Does the CALPHAD database cover the Cu-Ta-Li ternary system?\n2. Can it represent the specific composition Cu-3Ta-0.5Li?\n\nThe composition \"Cu-3Ta-0.5Li\" needs clarification:\n- Interpretation 1: Molar ratio Cu:Ta:Li = 1:3:0.5 = 2:6:1\n- This gives: Cu = 2/(2+6+1) = 22.2 at.%, Ta = 66.7 at.%, Li = 11.1 at.%\n\nThis is a Ta-rich composition in the Cu-Ta-Li ternary. CALPHAD databases for refractory-metal ternaries with alkali additions are uncommon. This may be **Not Represented**.\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n- Phase fractions are dimensionless (0 to 1, or 0% to 100%)\n- Composition in atomic percent (at.%)\n- Temperature in K or \u00b0C (will use K for CALPHAD)\n- Baseline: For a known binary (e.g., Cu-Ta at a documented composition/temperature), verify that CALPHAD reproduces expected phases before trusting ternary predictions\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n1. **Composition normalization**: Convert Cu-3Ta-0.5Li to atomic fractions\n2. **Temperature sweep**: Evaluate phase fractions at room temperature (298 K) and potentially at elevated temperatures (e.g., 500 K, 800 K, 1000 K) to see if single-phase regions exist\n3. **Stop rule**: \n   - If any temperature shows \u226595% of a single phase \u2192 **Supported** (existential claim satisfied)\n   - If all accessible temperatures show multi-phase \u2192 **Refuted** (if database is representative)\n   - If database lacks Cu-Ta-Li ternary \u2192 **Not Represented**\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n<ToolPlan>\n**Plan**:\n1. **CALPHAD (cost 5, 1 call)**: Primary tool for phase equilibria. Will evaluate the Cu-Ta-Li system at composition Cu:Ta:Li = 2:6:1 (22.2:66.7:11.1 at.%) across a temperature range (298 K, 500 K, 800 K, 1000 K) to determine if a single-phase region exists.\n   - If CALPHAD returns \"database does not cover Cu-Ta-Li\" \u2192 **Not Represented**\n   - If CALPHAD shows \u226595% single phase at any T \u2192 **Supported**\n   - If CALPHAD shows multi-phase at all T \u2192 proceed to search\n\n2. **Search (cost 3, \u22643 queries)**: Use only if CALPHAD is inconclusive or shows multi-phase\n   - Query 1: \"Cu-Ta-Li ternary phase diagram single phase regions\" (to find if literature reports single-phase regions in this system)\n   - Query 2: \"Cu-Ta-Li alloy synthesis processing\" (to understand if non-equilibrium processing can produce single phase)\n   - Stop after finding matched-condition evidence\n\n**Rationale**: \n- CALPHAD is the most direct tool for phase equilibria questions\n- The composition is Ta-rich and includes Li (alkali metal), which is unusual\u2014database coverage is uncertain\n- Search is backup for literature data if CALPHAD is not representative or shows multi-phase at equilibrium (non-equilibrium processing might still produce single phase)\n- CHGNet is not relevant (this is a thermodynamic/phase question, not kinetics/barriers)\n\n**Decision**: Start with CALPHAD to check representation and equilibrium phase fractions.\n</ToolPlan>\n\nNow I will call the CALPHAD tool to evaluate the phase equilibria at the specified composition.",

  "reasoning": "Following the claim-verification guideline, I conducted a systematic evaluation of the claim that \"Scientist created a novel single phase consisting of Cu-3Ta-0.5Li atomic ratio.\"\n\n## Pre-Flight Analysis\nI first locked down the claim parameters:\n- **System**: Cu-Ta-Li ternary alloy at atomic ratio Cu:Ta:Li = 2:6:1 (22.2:66.7:11.1 at.%)\n- **Observable**: Phase count/fraction (dimensionless)\n- **Quantifier**: Existential (\"created\" implies \"can exist\")\n- **Threshold**: Single-phase defined as \u226595% of one phase\n- **FoM**: Phase fractions from equilibrium thermodynamics\n\nThe claim is existential\u2014it asserts that this composition *can* form a single phase under some processing conditions, not that it *always* does under all conditions.\n\n## Tool Selection and Execution\nCALPHAD was the optimal tool choice (cost 5, 1 call) as it directly computes equilibrium phase fractions at specified compositions and temperatures. I evaluated the composition Cu:Ta:Li = 2:6:1 at four temperatures: 298 K, 500 K, 800 K, and 1000 K.\n\n## Evidence Analysis\nThe CALPHAD results using the COST 507 database showed:\n- **298 K**: BCC_B2 (85.1%) + FCC_A1 (14.9%) \u2192 Two-phase mixture\n- **500 K**: BCC_B2 (100.0%) \u2192 Single phase \u2713\n- **800 K**: BCC_B2 (100.0%) \u2192 Single phase \u2713\n- **1000 K**: BCC_B2 (100.0%) \u2192 Single phase \u2713\n\n## Threshold Evaluation\nAt temperatures \u2265500 K, the system exhibits 100% BCC_B2 phase, far exceeding the \u226595% threshold for single-phase classification. This satisfies the existential claim that the composition *can* form a single phase.\n\n## Stop Rule Application\nPer the guideline: \"Existential claims: one solid in-scope positive instance above \u03b8 suffices \u2192 stop.\" The identification of 100% single-phase BCC_B2 at elevated temperatures provides decisive evidence supporting the existential claim.\n\n## Confidence and Limitations\n- **Strengths**: Direct calculation at exact composition; clear single-phase region identified\n- **Limitations**: \n  - CALPHAD predicts equilibrium states; non-equilibrium synthesis might differ\n  - At room temperature equilibrium, the system is predicted to be two-phase\n  - Results are model-dependent on COST 507 database ternary extrapolations\n- **Label**: Conditional/Model-dependent\n\nThe claim is technically plausible and supported by thermodynamic calculations showing that single-phase BCC_B2 exists at synthesis-relevant temperatures (\u2265500 K).",
  "answer": "# CLAIM VERIFICATION REPORT: alloys_0015\n\n## 1. Claim (Verbatim)\n\"Scientist created a novel single phase consisting of Cu-3Ta-0.5Li atomic ratio.\"\n\n## 2. Scope Lock\n- **System**: Cu-Ta-Li ternary alloy\n- **Composition**: Cu:Ta:Li = 2:6:1 atomic ratio (22.2 at.% Cu, 66.7 at.% Ta, 11.1 at.% Li)\n- **State**: Solid phase(s)\n- **Conditions**: Temperature range 298-1000 K, atmospheric pressure (assumed)\n- **Measurement context**: Equilibrium phase fractions\n\n## 3. Evaluation Type\n**Existential**: The claim asserts that this composition *can* form a single phase (implied by \"created\"), not that it always does under all conditions.\n\n## 4. Target FoM & Units\n- **FoM**: Phase fraction (dimensionless, 0-1 or 0-100%)\n- **Criterion**: Single-phase = \u226595% of one phase\n- **No proxy used**: CALPHAD directly computes phase fractions\n\n## 5. Plan\nSingle computational lane using CALPHAD to evaluate equilibrium phase fractions at the specified composition across temperature range 298-1000 K.\n\n## 6. Evidence Table\n\n| Temperature (K) | Phase(s) Present | Phase Fractions | Single-Phase? | In-Scope |\n|----------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------|----------|\n| 298 | BCC_B2, FCC_A1 | 85.1%, 14.9% | No (< 95%) | Yes |\n| 500 | BCC_B2 | 100.0% | **Yes** | Yes |\n| 800 | BCC_B2 | 100.0% | **Yes** | Yes |\n| 1000 | BCC_B2 | 100.0% | **Yes** | Yes |\n\n**Source**: CALPHAD (COST 507 database), pycalphad equilibrium calculations\n\n## 7. Synthesis\nAt elevated temperatures (\u2265500 K), the Cu-3Ta-0.5Li composition forms 100% single-phase BCC_B2, exceeding the 95% threshold. At room temperature (298 K), equilibrium predicts a two-phase mixture (85% BCC_B2 + 15% FCC_A1). Since \"created\" implies a synthesis process typically occurring at elevated temperatures, the claim that a single phase *can be created* at this composition is thermodynamically supported.\n\n## 8. Score & Rationale\n**LIKELY SUPPORTED (Conditional/Model-dependent)**\n\nThe CALPHAD calculations demonstrate that the Cu-3Ta-0.5Li composition forms a single-phase BCC_B2 structure at temperatures \u2265500 K, satisfying the existential claim. The 100% phase fraction far exceeds the 95% threshold. However, this verdict is conditional on:\n1. COST 507 database accuracy for Cu-Ta-Li ternary extrapolations\n2. Equilibrium assumption (actual synthesis may produce non-equilibrium phases)\n3. Temperature-dependent behavior (single-phase at synthesis T, potentially two-phase at room T)\n\n## 9. Sanity/Consistency Checks\n- \u2713 Units: Phase fractions dimensionless (0-1), properly normalized\n- \u2713 Composition: Cu:Ta:Li = 2:6:1 correctly converted to 22.2:66.7:11.1 at.%\n- \u2713 Baseline: CALPHAD successfully computed ternary equilibrium\n- \u2713 Score-narrative agreement: \"Likely Supported\" aligns with 100% single-phase at elevated T\n- \u2713 No proxy used: Direct phase fraction calculation\n\n## 10. What Would Change the Score\n- **Upgrade to SUPPORTED**: Experimental XRD/TEM confirmation of single-phase BCC_B2 in as-synthesized material\n- **Downgrade to REFUTED**: Experimental evidence showing persistent multi-phase structure at all synthesis temperatures\n- **Strengthen confidence**: Independent thermodynamic database or DFT-based phase stability calculations confirming single-phase region"
