      "citation": "LiPF6 has relatively high stability in dry inert environments up to 107 \u00b0C, but degrades rapidly when exposed to water or moisture. The PF5 formed can then react with the water present in the electrolyte to form hydrofluoric acid (HF). In commercial lithium-ion batteries, this behavior must not occur, and it is therefore essential to control the presence of water and moisture not only in the electrolytes but also in the other parts of battery system during the manufacturing process."
