Given typical Tc measurement precision (~0.1-0.5 K), a meaningful threshold would be \u22650.5 K difference.\n</ClaimCard>\n\n<VerbMapping>\n\"has a higher\" \u2192 A15 Tc > tetragonal Tc by at least \u03b8\n\"regardless of pressure\" \u2192 universal quantifier: must hold at all pressures (ambient and elevated)\nThis is a comparative claim requiring Tc values for both phases across pressure conditions.\n</VerbMapping>\n\n<MetricIntegrity>\nThe FoM is explicitly Tc (superconducting critical temperature). This is a well-defined experimental observable measured in Kelvin. No proxy is needed - we need direct Tc values or calculations for both crystal structures.\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\n- **CALPHAD**: Not appropriate - CALPHAD handles thermodynamic phase stability but does not compute electronic properties like superconducting Tc.\n- **CHGNet MLIP**: Not appropriate - CHGNet is a structural/energetic model without superconducting property prediction capability.\n- **Search tool**: Most appropriate - Tc values for different Nb3Si polymorphs are experimental/computational data available in literature. A15 Nb3Si is a well-studied superconductor.\n\nNeither computational tool can represent superconducting critical temperature. This is fundamentally an electronic structure property requiring either experimental data or specialized DFT+electron-phonon coupling calculations, which are outside the scope of available tools.\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\nUnits: Kelvin (K) for Tc. No conversion needed.\nBaseline: A15 Nb3Sn (a related A15 compound) has Tc ~ 18 K, providing a sanity check for A15 Nb3Si values.\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\nSince this is a **universal claim** (\"regardless of pressure\"), a single counterexample suffices to refute it.\nMinimal decisive test:\n1. Search for Tc values of A15 Nb3Si at ambient and elevated pressures\n2. Search for Tc values of tetragonal Nb3Si at ambient and elevated pressures\n3. Compare: if tetragonal Tc \u2265 A15 Tc at any pressure, claim is refuted\n4. If A15 Tc > tetragonal Tc at all documented pressures, claim is supported (within literature scope)\n\nStop rule: One well-documented instance where tetragonal Tc \u2265 A15 Tc refutes the universal claim.\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n<ToolPlan>\nGiven that neither CALPHAD nor CHGNet can compute superconducting Tc, I must rely on the search tool to find:\n1. Experimental or computational Tc data for A15 Nb3Si (cubic Pm-3n structure)\n2. Experimental or computational Tc data for tetragonal Nb3Si\n3. Pressure dependence of Tc for both phases if available\n\nSearch strategy:\n- Query 1: Focus on A15 Nb3Si superconducting properties and Tc values\n- Query 2 (if needed): Focus on tetragonal Nb3Si and its superconducting properties\n- Query 3 (if needed): Pressure effects on Nb3Si superconductivity\n\nThis is a literature-based verification since the computational tools cannot represent the required FoM.\n</ToolPlan>\n\n## Initial Plan Evaluation\n\nThe plan is optimal because:\n1. Neither computational tool can calculate Tc\n2. Search is the only viable tool (cost 3, up to 3 queries)\n3. For a universal claim, finding one counterexample is decisive\n4. The search queries are targeted and non-redundant\n\nI'll start with a comprehensive search query covering both phases and pressure effects.",
