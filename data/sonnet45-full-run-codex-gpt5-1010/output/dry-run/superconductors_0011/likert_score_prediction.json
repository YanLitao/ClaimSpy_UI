  "reasoning": "+1 (Partially Feasible) because A15 Nb3Si has well\u2011documented Tc values (\u224818 K at ambient, decreasing to \u22485 K by ~90 GPa) while tetragonal Nb3Si shows no reported superconductivity (and Ti3P-type analogs, when superconducting, have Tc <1 K), strongly supporting higher Tc for A15 across accessible pressures; however, the universal \u201cregardless of pressure\u201d scope and lack of direct Tc vs P data for tetragonal Nb3Si prevent a full +2.\n\n- Necessary minima:\n  - Both A15 and tetragonal Nb3Si can exist/be assessed under the compared pressure.\n  - A15 Nb3Si is superconducting and its Tc as a function of pressure is known.\n  - Tetragonal Nb3Si has Tc that does not exceed A15\u2019s at the same pressures.\n\n- Evidence mapping:\n  - Direct (matching): A15 Nb3Si Tc \u224818 K (ambient), monotonic decrease with pressure to \u22485.2 K at ~88 GPa; multiple sources.\n  - Indirect/proxy: No reports of superconductivity for tetragonal Nb3Si; Ti3P-type A3B compounds show Tc <1 K when superconducting; tetragonal Nb3Si not listed as superconducting. Explosive compression converts tetragonal \u2192 A15, with superconductivity only in A15.\n  - Contradictions: None found (no case where tetragonal Tc \u2265 A15 Tc at any reported pressure).\n\n- Why not \u20132/\u20131: No fundamental or quantitative contradiction; data trend consistently favors A15.\n- Why not 0: Evidence direction is clearly for the claim; not merely underspecified.\n- Why not +2: Universal \u201cregardless of pressure\u201d not fully evidenced (infinite P not covered), and tetragonal Tc under pressure lacks direct, condition\u2011matched measurements.\n\n- Assumptions/limitations: Tetragonal Nb3Si Tc vs pressure is inferred from absence in literature and analogs; both phases may not be simultaneously stable at all pressures; evaluation implicitly bounded by experimentally explored pressures (~0\u2013100+ GPa).",
