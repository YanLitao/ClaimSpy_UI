  "reasoning": "- Call: \u20132 (Infeasible) because the core requirement\u2014single\u2011phase Mg\u2013Nd at 40% Nd (wt.% or at.%) at ambient conditions\u2014fatally contradicts authoritative Mg\u2013Nd phase equilibria, and no credible rapid\u2011solidification route or LPBF precedent supports suppressing the large thermodynamic driving force for two\u2011phase separation at this composition.\n- Claim decomposition (must all hold):\n  1) A single\u2011phase solid solution or single\u2011phase intermetallic at 40% Nd exists at ambient in LPBF parts. 2) LPBF rapid solidification produces a banded microstructure. 3) The alloy is low density. 4) Such microstructure will enable localized strength/corrosion optimization.\n- Evidence mapping:\n  - Direct/authoritative against: Mg\u2013Nd phase diagrams/CALPHAD place both 40 wt.% Nd (~10 at.%) and 40 at.% Nd firmly in two\u2011phase fields at room temperature with substantial secondary phase fractions; solubility of Nd in Mg at RT is very low. This is a fatal mismatch with \u201csingle phase.\u201d\n  - Absence of supporting evidence: No reports of LPBF\u2011produced, metastable single\u2011phase Mg\u2013Nd anywhere near 40% Nd; no metastable phase diagram or rapid\u2011solidification study showing solubility extension to that level.\n  - Indirect/plausible but non\u2011decisive: \u201cLow density\u201d is plausible for 40 wt.% Nd mixtures; banded microstructures can occur under rapid solidification in principle. These do not rescue the single\u2011phase claim.\n- Why not \u20131: The obstacle is fundamental (thermodynamics/phase stability) under the stated conditions; making it true would require incompatible/non\u2011evidenced metastability at extreme supersaturation.\n- Why not 0/+1/+2: Not underspecified (key condition is composition vs phase), and there is no aligned evidence that all minima can hold; core element fails.\n- Assumptions/limits: Treats \u201csingle phase\u201d as \u2265~95% by volume; considers both wt.% and at.% interpretations\u2014both are multiphase at ambient; LPBF thermal cycling further disfavors retaining extreme supersaturation.",
