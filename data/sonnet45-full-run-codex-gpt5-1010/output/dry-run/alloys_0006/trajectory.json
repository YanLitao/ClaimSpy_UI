For stability: thermodynamic equilibrium (minimized Gibbs free energy) rather than metastability.\n</ClaimCard>\n\n<VerbMapping>\n- \"stable composition\" \u2192 thermodynamically stable (equilibrium state, not metastable)\n- \"has been observed\" \u2192 existential claim; one valid composition suffices\n- \"involving a two-phase equilibrium\" \u2192 both phases present with non-zero fractions at equilibrium\n- \"between Ti4Nb3Al9 and beta titanium\" \u2192 these two specific phases coexist on a tie-line\n</VerbMapping>\n\n<MetricIntegrity>\nThe FoM is **phase equilibrium at specified T**. CALPHAD directly computes this via Gibbs energy minimization and produces phase fractions vs. composition/temperature. This is an exact match\u2014no proxy needed. The tool outputs phase identities and fractions, which directly answer whether the two-phase field exists.\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\n**CALPHAD representation check:**\n- Ti-Al-Nb is a well-studied aerospace alloy system; major databases (e.g., TCTI, PanTitanium) include it.\n- Ti4Nb3Al9 is a specific intermetallic compound. Need to verify:\n  1. Does the database contain this stoichiometric compound?\n  2. Is \u03b2-Ti (bcc_a2 or similar) represented?\n  3. Can the tool compute ternary isothermal sections at 1000\u00b0C?\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- Ti4Nb3Al9 has stoichiometry Ti:Nb:Al = 4:3:9 = 25 at% Ti, 18.75 at% Nb, 56.25 at% Al. This is Al-rich. Some databases may not include all ternary compounds, especially if they are less common or metastable.\n- If Ti4Nb3Al9 is not in the database, the tool cannot verify the claim \u2192 **Not Represented**.\n\n**Decision:** Proceed with CALPHAD as the primary tool. If Ti4Nb3Al9 is not represented, return **Not Represented / Out of Scope**.\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n**Units:**\n- Temperature: 1000\u00b0C = 1273.15 K\n- Composition: atomic percent (at%)\n- Phase fractions: mole fraction or weight fraction (will clarify from tool output)\n\n**Baseline validation:**\n- Known: \u03b2-Ti is stable at high T in Ti-rich compositions\n- Known: Ti-Al system has multiple intermetallics (TiAl, Ti3Al, TiAl3, etc.)\n- Known: Nb stabilizes \u03b2-Ti\n- Baseline test: Verify that pure Ti at 1273 K shows \u03b2-Ti as stable (it should, since \u03b2-transus for pure Ti is ~882\u00b0C). If this fails, the database or setup is incorrect.\n\n**Round-trip check:** 1273.15 K \u2192 1000\u00b0C \u2713\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n**Test strategy (existential claim):**\n1. **Representation check:** Query the database for Ti4Nb3Al9 compound. If absent \u2192 Not Represented.\n2. **Isothermal section at 1000\u00b0C:** Compute phase equilibria across the ternary composition space.\n3. **Target search:** Look for a two-phase region where Ti4Nb3Al9 + \u03b2-Ti coexist.\n4. **Verification:** If such a region exists with non-zero fractions of both phases, the claim is **Supported**.\n5. **Stop rule:** One valid tie-line suffices (existential). If no such region exists, the claim is **Refuted** (assuming representation is adequate).\n\n**Replicates/configurations:** Not needed for thermodynamic equilibrium (deterministic at given T, P, database).\n\n**Sensitivity:** If the result is borderline or the compound is near a phase boundary, a small T sweep (\u00b150\u00b0C) would be prudent, but given budget constraints, we'll evaluate at exactly 1000\u00b0C first.\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n---\n\n## Tool Plan\n\n<ToolPlan>\n**Primary tool: CALPHAD (cost 5, 1 call allowed)**\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The claim is about **thermodynamic phase equilibrium** at a specific T in a ternary system.\n- CALPHAD is the gold-standard method for this question.\n- The FoM (two-phase coexistence) is directly computed.\n\n**Execution:**\n1. Call `calphad` with the question focused on verifying the two-phase equilibrium Ti4Nb3Al9 + \u03b2-Ti at 1000\u00b0C.\n2. Request:\n   - Confirmation that Ti4Nb3Al9 is in the database\n   - Isothermal section or targeted phase equilibrium calculation at 1273 K\n   - Identification of two-phase regions involving these phases\n3. If Ti4Nb3Al9 is not represented \u2192 return **Not Represented**.\n4. If the two-phase field exists \u2192 **Supported**.\n5. If it does not exist (e.g., Ti4Nb3Al9 is unstable at 1000\u00b0C, or the phases do not coexist) \u2192 **Refuted**.\n\n**Backup (if needed, budget permitting):**\n- **search_tool** (cost 3, up to 3 calls): Use only if CALPHAD result is ambiguous or if we need to verify the existence of Ti4Nb3Al9 compound in the literature. However, for a thermodynamic claim, CALPHAD should be decisive.\n- Given the tool policy (\"if either calphad or chgnet_mlip is appropriate, call the one most suitable regardless of cost\"), and this is a pure thermodynamics question, CALPHAD is the clear choice.\n\n**Expected outcome:**\n- CALPHAD will either confirm or refute the two-phase equilibrium.\n- If confirmed, we have a **Supported** verdict (existential claim satisfied).\n- If refuted, we have a **Refuted** verdict.\n- If Ti4Nb3Al9 is not in the database, we have **Not Represented / Inconclusive**.\n\n**Stop rule:**\n- After CALPHAD call, if the answer is clear (two-phase field exists or does not exist), **STOP**. Do not call additional tools.\n- Only use search_tool if CALPHAD output is unclear or if we need to contextualize an unexpected result (e.g., database limitations).\n</ToolPlan>\n\n---\n\n## Next Step\n\nI will now call the **calphad** tool to verify the claim. The question will ask whether the two-phase equilibrium between Ti4Nb3Al9 and \u03b2-Ti exists at 1000\u00b0C in the Ti-Al-Nb system.",
