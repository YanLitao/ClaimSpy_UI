  "reasoning": "\u20132 (Infeasible) because the claim requires the existence of a specific compound (Ti4Nb3Al9) that is not documented in authoritative thermodynamic databases or peer\u2011reviewed literature; without that phase, a two\u2011phase equilibrium at 1000\u00b0C cannot occur as stated.\n\nClaim decomposition (minima that must all hold):\n- The compound Ti4Nb3Al9 exists as a distinct phase in Ti\u2013Al\u2013Nb.\n- \u03b2\u2011Ti (BCC_A2) is stable near 1000\u00b0C (true in Ti-rich regions).\n- At 1000\u00b0C, there is a two\u2011phase equilibrium tie\u2011line between Ti4Nb3Al9 and \u03b2\u2011Ti.\n\nEvidence mapping:\n- Direct/authoritative: cost507 Ti\u2013Al\u2013Nb database lacks Ti4Nb3Al9 (phase absent \u2192 contradicts existence).\n- Literature searches: No reports of Ti4Nb3Al9; instead, Ti4NbAl3 (\u03c9o) is known with different stoichiometry \u2192 not the claimed compound.\n- Targeted query for \u201cTi4Nb3Al9\u201d: zero hits \u2192 further contradicts existence.\n\nWhy not other Likert values:\n- Not \u20131: This is not a range/parameter mismatch but a fundamental absence of the required phase.\n- Not 0: Evidence is not merely insufficient; multiple aligned sources indicate non\u2011existence.\n- Not +1/+2: The core prerequisite (phase existence) fails; no partial feasibility without the phase.\n\nAssumptions/limitations:\n- Relies on widely used Ti\u2013Al\u2013Nb databases and accessible literature; if Ti4Nb3Al9 were an extremely recent or obscure report, it could be missed, but convergence of multiple sources makes this unlikely.\n- Even if a misprint intended Ti4NbAl3, that is a different claim and requires separate verification.",
