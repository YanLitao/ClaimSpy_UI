  "reasoning": "+2 (Feasible) because direct, condition-matched experimental evidence (Science journal report on Cu-3Ta-0.5Li) demonstrates all required elements: a nanostructured Cu-Ta-Li alloy with complexion-stabilized (Ta-rich bilayer) precipitate interfaces, yield strength of 1.12 GPa at room temperature, and demonstrated microstructural robustness at temperatures approaching Cu\u2019s melting point, which encompasses 800 C.\n\nClaim decomposition (minima that must all hold):\n- Existence of a nanostructured Cu\u2013Ta\u2013Li alloy with complexion-stabilized precipitates.\n- Yield strength > 1 GPa at room temperature.\n- Structural robustness (no catastrophic coarsening/softening; precipitate/grain boundary stability) up to 800 C.\n\nEvidence mapping:\n- Direct experimental (matching conditions): Cu-3Ta-0.5Li alloy with measured RT yield strength of 1.12 GPa (>1 GPa threshold). Reports of resistance to coarsening and creep near Cu\u2019s Tm (~1085 C), implying robustness \u2265800 C. Mechanism explicitly described as L12 Cu3Li precipitates with Ta-rich bilayer complexions.\n- No contradictions noted; evidence and conditions align with the claim.\n\nWhy not other Likert values:\n- Not +1: No critical element is missing; both property and high-T stability are directly evidenced under aligned conditions.\n- Not 0/\u20131: Evidence is not ambiguous or misaligned; magnitude exceeds typical error.\n- Not \u20132: No fundamental or thermodynamic contradiction.\n\nAssumptions/limitations:\n- Existential claim requires at least one successful instance; reproducibility across labs not required for feasibility. Confidence could be further bolstered by independent replications, but current evidence suffices.",
