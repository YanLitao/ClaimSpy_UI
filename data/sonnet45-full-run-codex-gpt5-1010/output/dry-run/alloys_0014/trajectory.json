Yield strength (\u03c3_y) at room temperature, units: GPa. Claim threshold: >1 GPa\n2. Structural robustness up to 800\u00b0C (thermal stability of microstructure)\n**Quantifier:** Existential (\"created a...alloy\") - the claim asserts that such an alloy can exist/has been created with these properties\n**Threshold \u03b8:** \n- For yield strength: \u03c3_y > 1.0 GPa at room temperature (explicit in claim)\n- For thermal stability: microstructure remains stable (precipitates retained, no catastrophic coarsening/dissolution) up to 800\u00b0C\n</ClaimCard>\n\n<VerbMapping>\n- \"created\" \u2192 existential claim; we need to verify technical plausibility, not discovery/novelty\n- \"structurally robust up to 800\u00b0C\" \u2192 thermal stability; nanostructure/precipitates persist without catastrophic degradation\n- \"yielding strength in excess of 1 gigapascal\" \u2192 \u03c3_y > 1.0 GPa at room temperature (explicit threshold)\n- \"complexion-stabilized precipitates\" \u2192 specific stabilization mechanism involving grain boundary complexions\n</VerbMapping>\n\n<MetricIntegrity>\nTwo distinct FoMs:\n1. **Yield strength (\u03c3_y)** at room temperature - mechanical property, units GPa\n2. **Thermal stability** up to 800\u00b0C - microstructural persistence\n\nThese are the exact FoMs claimed. No proxy is needed initially, though:\n- Yield strength requires either experimental data or validated structure-property models\n- Thermal stability requires thermodynamic assessment (phase stability, precipitate dissolution temperatures) and potentially kinetic barriers\n\nIf direct yield strength data is unavailable, we cannot use a proxy without explicit justification. Thermal stability can be assessed via CALPHAD (equilibrium phases, solvus temperatures).\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\n**Available tools:**\n1. **search_tool** - can find literature on Cu-Ta-Li alloys, yield strength data, thermal stability reports, complexion stabilization mechanisms\n2. **calphad** - can assess thermodynamic stability, phase equilibria, precipitate stability in Cu-Ta-Li system IF database exists\n3. **chgnet_mlip** - primarily for kinetic barriers, diffusion; less relevant for bulk yield strength or equilibrium phase stability\n\n**Representation concerns:**\n- Cu-Ta-Li is a ternary system; CALPHAD databases may not include Li-containing ternary intermetallics\n- Yield strength is a mechanical property not directly computed by CALPHAD or CHGNet\n- Complexion stabilization is a grain boundary phenomenon requiring specialized treatment\n- CHGNet could assess diffusion barriers but won't directly give yield strength\n\n**Decision:** \n- **search_tool** is most appropriate for finding matched-condition data on Cu-Ta-Li yield strength and thermal stability\n- **calphad** may help assess phase stability and precipitate solvus temperatures IF the Cu-Ta-Li system is represented\n- **chgnet_mlip** is likely out of scope for this claim (no direct pathway to yield strength or thermal stability assessment)\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n**Units:**\n- Yield strength: GPa (claim) = 10^9 Pa\n- Temperature: \u00b0C (claim); convert to K for thermodynamic calculations: T(K) = T(\u00b0C) + 273.15\n  - 800\u00b0C = 1073.15 K\n  - Room temperature \u2248 25\u00b0C = 298.15 K\n\n**Baseline/sanity checks:**\n- Pure Cu: \u03c3_y \u2248 0.03-0.07 GPa (annealed), up to ~0.3 GPa (work-hardened)\n- Pure Ta: \u03c3_y \u2248 0.17-0.35 GPa (annealed)\n- Nanostructured/precipitation-strengthened alloys can achieve >1 GPa (e.g., some Al alloys, steels, superalloys)\n- Cu melting point: 1085\u00b0C; Ta melting point: 3017\u00b0C\n- 800\u00b0C is 0.79 T_m,Cu (homologous temperature) - significant for diffusion/coarsening\n\n**Round-trip check:** 1 GPa = 1000 MPa = 10^9 Pa \u2192 1 GPa \u2713\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n**Existential claim:** Need to show that a Cu-Ta-Li alloy with the stated properties is technically plausible.\n\n**Test sequence:**\n1. **Search for Cu-Ta-Li alloy data** (cost 3, 1-2 queries):\n   - Query 1: Cu-Ta-Li alloy yield strength, mechanical properties, nanostructured\n   - Query 2 (if needed): Cu-Ta-Li thermal stability, high-temperature stability, complexion stabilization\n   \n2. **CALPHAD assessment** (cost 5, 1 run) - IF search is inconclusive:\n   - Check phase stability in Cu-Ta-Li system\n   - Assess precipitate stability at 800\u00b0C\n   - Identify potential strengthening phases\n   \n**Stop rules:**\n- If search finds matched-condition data showing \u03c3_y > 1 GPa at RT and stability to 800\u00b0C \u2192 STOP (existential satisfied)\n- If search finds fundamental contradiction (e.g., system is liquid at 800\u00b0C, no stable precipitates possible) \u2192 STOP (refuted)\n- If search is inconclusive but suggests plausibility, use CALPHAD to assess thermodynamic feasibility\n- Do NOT use CHGNet unless kinetic barriers become the decisive question (unlikely here)\n\n**Priority:** Start with search_tool (lower cost, direct access to experimental data if available)\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n<ToolPlan>\n**Plan:**\n1. **search_tool** (Query 1): Search for Cu-Ta-Li alloy mechanical properties, yield strength, nanostructured alloys, high-temperature stability. This should reveal if such alloys have been studied and what properties are reported.\n\n2. **Decision point after Query 1:**\n   - If matched data found with \u03c3_y > 1 GPa and thermal stability to 800\u00b0C \u2192 finish\n   - If no Cu-Ta-Li data but related systems suggest plausibility \u2192 Query 2 or CALPHAD\n   - If fundamental contradiction found \u2192 finish\n\n3. **search_tool** (Query 2, if needed): Focus on complexion stabilization in Cu alloys, thermal stability mechanisms, or Cu-Ta binary if ternary data is sparse.\n\n4. **calphad** (if needed): Assess Cu-Ta-Li phase equilibria, precipitate stability, solvus temperatures. This is secondary because yield strength cannot be directly computed.\n\n**Rationale:** \n- Search first because yield strength is a mechanical property requiring experimental data or validated models\n- CALPHAD can support thermal stability assessment but cannot verify yield strength\n- CHGNet is not appropriate for this claim (no direct pathway to FoMs)\n- Minimize tool calls: 1-2 searches should be sufficient for an existential claim\n</ToolPlan>\n\nNow I'll execute Query 1 with search_tool to look for Cu-Ta-Li alloy data.",

  "answer": "# Claim Verification Report: Cu-Ta-Li High-Temperature Nanostructured Alloy\n\n## 1. Claim (Verbatim)\n\"Scientist created a high-temperature nanostructured Cu-Ta-Li alloy with complexion-stabilized precipitates that is structurally robust up to 800 C, with a yielding strength in excess of 1 gigapascal at room temperature.\"\n\n## 2. Scope Lock\n- **System:** Cu-Ta-Li ternary alloy, specifically Cu-3Ta-0.5Li (atomic %)\n- **Manipulation:** Alloying and processing to achieve nanocrystalline structure with complexion-stabilized precipitates\n- **Measurement context:** Yield strength at room temperature (~298 K); thermal stability up to 800\u00b0C (1073 K)\n- **Constraints:** Ambient pressure; bulk nanocrystalline alloy\n\n## 3. Evaluation Type\n**Existential** - The claim asserts that such an alloy can exist/has been created with the specified properties.\n\n## 4. Target FoM & Units\n1. **Yield strength (\u03c3_y):** GPa at room temperature; threshold >1.0 GPa\n2. **Thermal stability:** Microstructural persistence (precipitate retention, resistance to coarsening) up to 800\u00b0C\n\nNo surrogate metrics required; direct measurements available.\n\n## 5. Plan\nSingle search query to find matched-condition experimental data on Cu-Ta-Li alloy mechanical properties and thermal stability. Stop if existential threshold met.\n\n## 6. Evidence Table\n\n| Source | Setup | Raw Output | FoM Value | Uncertainty | In-Scope |\n|--------|-------|------------|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| Science journal (via multiple outlets) | Cu-3Ta-0.5Li at%, RT testing | 1120 MPa yield strength | 1.12 GPa | \u00b1measurement error (not specified, typically ~2-5%) | \u2713 Yes |\n| Same | Cu-3Ta-0.5Li, high-T testing | \"Resistance to coarsening near melting point\" | Stable >800\u00b0C | Qualitative | \u2713 Yes |\n| PubMed abstract | Cu-3Ta-0.5Li, mechanism study | \"Excellent thermal stability\" via complexion-stabilized precipitates | Mechanism confirmed | N/A | \u2713 Yes |\n\n## 7. Synthesis\nThe experimental evidence from peer-reviewed literature (Science journal) confirms:\n- **Yield strength:** 1.12 GPa at room temperature, exceeding the 1.0 GPa threshold by 12%\n- **Thermal stability:** Demonstrated resistance to coarsening and creep deformation at temperatures approaching Cu's melting point (1085\u00b0C), well above the 800\u00b0C claim threshold\n- **Mechanism:** Complexion-stabilized precipitates explicitly described (Ta-rich atomic bilayer complexions surrounding L1\u2082 Cu\u2083Li precipitates)\n- **Composition:** Cu-3Ta-0.5Li matches the claimed ternary system\n\nAll claim components are verified with matched-condition data. The magnitude exceeds thresholds with comfortable margins.\n\n## 8. Score & Rationale\n**STRONGLY SUPPORTED**\n\nThe claim is strongly supported by direct experimental evidence from peer-reviewed literature. The measured yield strength (1.12 GPa) exceeds the claimed threshold (>1 GPa) by 12%, well beyond typical measurement uncertainty. Thermal stability is confirmed through explicit testing showing resistance to microstructural degradation at temperatures exceeding 800\u00b0C. The complexion-stabilization mechanism is documented in detail. For an existential claim, this constitutes decisive positive evidence from matched conditions.\n\n## 9. Sanity/Consistency Checks\n- \u2713 Units: 1120 MPa = 1.12 GPa (correct conversion)\n- \u2713 Baseline: Nanostructured precipitation-strengthened alloys achieving >1 GPa is physically reasonable\n- \u2713 Temperature: 800\u00b0C = 0.79 T_m,Cu (high but below melting, appropriate for stability testing)\n- \u2713 No proxy metrics used; direct FoM measurements\n- \u2713 Score-narrative agreement: Strong experimental support \u2192 Strongly Supported\n\n## 10. What Would Change the Score\n**To weaken:** Evidence that the reported alloy cannot be reproduced, or that the testing methodology was flawed (e.g., measurement artifacts, composition errors).\n\n**To strengthen:** Already at maximum confidence for an existential claim; additional independent laboratory replications would reinforce but not change the fundamental verification."
