  "reasoning": "+1 (Partially Feasible) because: (i) metastable A15 Nb3Si has been reported from rapid\u2011quench routes (including melt spinning/rotating copper wheel) and shows Tc \u2248 18 K at ambient, while the equilibrium tetragonal Nb3Si is essentially non\u2011superconducting; (ii) A15 retains a measurable Tc under high pressure, and no competitive superconductivity has been reported for tetragonal Nb3Si up to very high pressures. However, the universal scope \u201cregardless of pressure\u201d is supported mainly by negative/absent tetragonal Tc(P) reports rather than explicit, condition\u2011matched Tc(P) data across the full pressure range, so a critical piece remains inferred.\n\nClaim decomposition (minima that must all hold):\n- Existence/route: A15 Nb3Si can be formed by rapid quenching on a rotating copper wheel (melt spinning) from a Nb\u2011rich alloy.\n- Phase identity: The product is indeed the A15 polymorph (not tetragonal or mixed).\n- Property at ambient: Tc(A15) > Tc(tetragonal).\n- Pressure universality: For any applied pressure in the experimentally relevant range, Tc(A15, P) > Tc(tetragonal, P).\n\nEvidence mapping:\n- Direct (matching): A15 Nb3Si Tc \u2248 18\u201318.5 K at ambient; A15 remains superconducting under pressure with Tc decreasing (e.g., ~5 K at ~88 GPa). Rapid\u2011quench routes (including melt spinning/explosive compression) reported to yield A15 Nb3Si.\n- Indirect/negative: Tetragonal Nb3Si described as essentially non\u2011superconducting at ambient; high\u2011pressure studies up to ~100\u2013120 GPa report no superconducting transition for tetragonal. This supports the inequality but is not a comprehensive, tabulated Tc(P) curve for the tetragonal phase.\n- Contradictions: None clearly established under the stated conditions, though historical reproducibility/phase\u2011purity questions around A15 Nb3Si exist.\n\nWhy not +2:\n- The \u201cregardless of pressure\u201d quantifier is substantiated largely by absence of tetragonal superconductivity reports rather than explicit, broad Tc(P) data for tetragonal; phase\u2011purity and reproducibility of A15 via melt spinning can be challenging, leaving a critical element inferred.\n\nWhy not 0/\u20131:\n- Multiple independent, condition\u2011matched measurements strongly support Tc(A15) \u226b Tc(tetragonal) at ambient and show A15 remains superconducting under pressure; there is no positive evidence that tetragonal surpasses A15 at any pressure.\n\nAssumptions/limitations:\n- Assumes reported melt\u2011spun samples are predominantly A15 and that pressure ranges considered are those typically accessible (up to ~100+ GPa).\n- Universal \u201cregardless of pressure\u201d is interpreted over practical positive pressures; explicit tetragonal Tc(P) data are sparse.",
