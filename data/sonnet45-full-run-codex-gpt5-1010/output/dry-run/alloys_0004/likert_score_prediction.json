  "reasoning": "- \u20131 (Partially Infeasible) because a key prerequisite in the claim\u2014an existing DFT prediction of a tetragonal Ti2Al3 phase\u2014is not evidenced, and equilibrium thermodynamics at Ti2Al3 composition favor decomposition into TiAl + Al2Ti, while no direct evidence is provided for either the precipitate\u2019s existence or the strengthening effect. Metastable precipitates are not fundamentally impossible, but the claim overstates support (\u201cpredicted by DFT\u201d) and lacks condition\u2011matched validation.\n\n- Necessary minima:\n  1) A DFT study predicting a tetragonal Ti2Al3\u2011like structure (as stated). \n  2) A metastable Ti2Al3\u2011consistent phase can form as precipitates in a lightweight alloy under accessible processing conditions.\n  3) Precipitates are compositionally/structurally verified (e.g., XRD/TEM/EDS) as Ti2Al3\u2011like.\n  4) The alloy is measurably strengthened due to these precipitates (mechanical testing).\n\n- Evidence mapping (from the report):\n  - Direct/contradictory: Literature searches found no DFT prediction of tetragonal Ti2Al3 (contradicts \u201chas been predicted by DFT\u201d).\n  - Thermodynamic baseline: CALPHAD at 40 at.% Ti/60 at.% Al shows TiAl + Al2Ti (\u22641260 K) and TiAl (>1260 K); no Ti2Al3 equilibrium phase (argues against stability at the stated stoichiometry; metastability not evidenced).\n  - Missing: Any experimental observation of such precipitates or mechanical strengthening.\n\n- Why not \u20132: Absence in equilibrium databases and literature does not prove fundamental impossibility of a metastable, nanoscale precipitate; metastable phases can exist outside CALPHAD equilibrium sets, and the processing window is unspecified.\n- Why not 0: The claim explicitly asserts a DFT prediction that appears absent, giving a concrete reason to lean negative rather than undecidable.\n- Why not +1/+2: No direct evidence of the precipitate\u2019s existence, structure, or strengthening effect; and the stated DFT basis is unsupported.\n\n- Assumptions/limitations: The evaluation assumes the \u201cTi2Al3 structure\u201d refers to the Ti\u2013Al system; metastable phases may be underrepresented in equilibrium databases; searches may miss very new or obscure reports.",
