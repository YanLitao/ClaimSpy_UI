For structural consistency: lattice parameters within ~5% of DFT predictions (typical DFT accuracy for metals).\n</ClaimCard>\n\n<VerbMapping>\n- \"strengthened by\" \u2192 precipitates contribute to strengthening (mechanism: precipitation hardening); requires demonstrating phase presence and plausible strengthening mechanism\n- \"metastable phase\" \u2192 phase exists but is not the global equilibrium; must show it can form and persist kinetically\n- \"consistent with\" \u2192 structural parameters (lattice constants, symmetry) match DFT predictions within computational uncertainty\n- \"predicted theoretically using DFT\" \u2192 DFT calculations support the existence and structure of this phase\n</VerbMapping>\n\n<MetricIntegrity>\nThe claim involves multiple interconnected aspects:\n1. **Phase existence:** Can Ti\u2082Al\u2083 with tetragonal structure exist (even if metastable)?\n2. **Structural verification:** Does the structure match DFT predictions?\n3. **Strengthening capability:** Can such precipitates strengthen an alloy?\n\nThe primary FoM is **phase existence/stability** of tetragonal Ti\u2082Al\u2083. Strengthening is a secondary consequence that follows from precipitate presence. I will focus on the phase existence question first, as it is the most fundamental and testable aspect.\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\n**CALPHAD:** Can assess Ti-Al phase diagram, equilibrium phases, and potentially metastable phase formation driving forces. Should be able to evaluate if Ti\u2082Al\u2083 composition is represented and what phases are predicted.\n\n**CHGNet MLIP:** Could potentially evaluate structural stability and energy landscapes, but may not have specific training on Ti-Al intermetallics. Less directly applicable than CALPHAD for phase stability questions.\n\n**Search:** Can find literature on Ti-Al system, Ti\u2082Al\u2083 phases, DFT predictions, and experimental observations of this phase.\n\n**Decision:** CALPHAD is most appropriate for assessing phase stability in Ti-Al system. Search can provide context on whether Ti\u2082Al\u2083 tetragonal phase has been reported/predicted.\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n- Phase fractions: dimensionless (0-1) or percentage (0-100%)\n- Temperature: K or \u00b0C (will standardize to K for calculations)\n- Composition: atomic fraction or at.% (will use atomic fraction)\n- Energy: eV/atom or J/mol (will convert as needed)\n\n**Baseline validation:** Will check if CALPHAD reproduces known Ti-Al phases (e.g., Ti\u2083Al (\u03b1\u2082), TiAl (\u03b3), TiAl\u2083) at appropriate compositions and temperatures.\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n**Stop rules:**\n- If Ti\u2082Al\u2083 composition shows no stable or metastable phase formation in CALPHAD \u2192 claim is questionable (but not definitively refuted, as metastable phases may not be in database)\n- If literature search shows no DFT predictions or experimental evidence of tetragonal Ti\u2082Al\u2083 \u2192 claim lacks support\n- If both CALPHAD and literature support the phase \u2192 claim is supported\n\n**Test sequence:**\n1. Search for literature on \"Ti2Al3 tetragonal\" and \"Ti-Al DFT predictions\" to establish if this phase has been theoretically predicted (cost: 3, 1-2 queries)\n2. If literature supports the phase, use CALPHAD to assess thermodynamic plausibility at Ti\u2082Al\u2083 composition (cost: 5, 1 run)\n3. Synthesize evidence\n\n**Replicates/configurations:** For CALPHAD, will evaluate at Ti\u2082Al\u2083 stoichiometry (40 at.% Ti, 60 at.% Al) across a temperature range (e.g., 300-1500 K) to assess stability windows.\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n<ToolPlan>\n**Planned sequence:**\n\n1. **Search (cost 3, query 1):** Search for \"Ti2Al3 tetragonal DFT density functional theory\" to find if this specific phase and structure has been predicted theoretically. This directly addresses the \"predicted theoretically using DFT\" aspect of the claim.\n\n2. **Conditional on search results:**\n   - If search finds strong DFT predictions of tetragonal Ti\u2082Al\u2083: Proceed to CALPHAD to assess thermodynamic plausibility\n   - If search finds no evidence: May need second search with broader terms, or conclude claim lacks literature support\n\n3. **CALPHAD (cost 5, 1 run):** Evaluate Ti-Al system at Ti\u2082Al\u2083 composition (Ti\u2080.\u2084Al\u2080.\u2086) across temperature range to:\n   - Identify what phases form at this composition\n   - Assess if Ti\u2082Al\u2083 or similar stoichiometry phases exist\n   - Evaluate metastability (e.g., formation driving force, proximity to equilibrium)\n\n**Rationale:** Search first because it's lower cost and can quickly establish if the theoretical prediction exists in literature. If the DFT prediction is well-documented, CALPHAD can then assess thermodynamic plausibility. If no DFT predictions are found, the claim's foundation is questionable and we may not need CALPHAD.\n\n**Budget check:** Search (3) + CALPHAD (5) = 8 total cost, well within budget. This is minimal and decisive.\n</ToolPlan>\n\nNow I will execute the plan, starting with a targeted literature search.",

Synthesis\n\n**Direction and magnitude vs. claim:**\n\nThe claim makes two testable assertions:\n1. **\"Predicted theoretically using density functional theory\"** \u2192 **REFUTED**\n   - Three literature searches found zero evidence of DFT predictions for tetragonal Ti\u2082Al\u2083\n   - The Ti-Al system is extensively studied; absence across broad searches is significant\n   - Known phases (Ti\u2083Al, TiAl, TiAl\u2083) are well-documented, but Ti\u2082Al\u2083 is not\n\n2. **\"Metastable phase consistent with tetragonal Ti\u2082Al\u2083 structure\"** \u2192 **NOT SUPPORTED**\n   - CALPHAD shows no Ti\u2082Al\u2083 phase at the claimed composition\n   - At 40 at.% Ti / 60 at.% Al, the system forms TiAl + Al\u2082Ti mixture\n   - Phase separation indicates Ti\u2082Al\u2083 stoichiometry is thermodynamically unfavorable\n   - No evidence of metastable Ti\u2082Al\u2083 in COST507R database\n\n**Thermodynamic interpretation:**\nThe Ti-Al system at Ti\u2082Al\u2083 composition prefers to decompose into:\n- TiAl (\u03b3 phase, 50:50 stoichiometry) \n- Al\u2082Ti (33:67 stoichiometry)\n\nThis phase separation suggests the 40:60 stoichiometry is not stable, even metastably.\n\n**Out-of-scope considerations (quarantined):**\n- CALPHAD databases may not include all metastable phases, particularly novel ones not yet synthesized\n- DFT predictions might exist in unpublished work or very recent preprints\n- The claim's use of \"novel\" might explain literature absence\n- However, these possibilities do not constitute evidence *for* the claim\n\n### 8. Score & Rationale\n\n**Score: 1/5 (Very Unlikely)**\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe claim fails on both testable components:\n\n1. **DFT prediction (claimed):** Zero literature evidence across three searches, including broad Ti-Al system queries. The Ti-Al system is mature and well-studied; a DFT prediction of a new phase would likely be published. The absence is significant.\n\n2. **Phase existence (implied):** CALPHAD calculations show no Ti\u2082Al\u2083 phase at the claimed composition. Instead, the system phase-separates into known phases (TiAl + Al\u2082Ti), indicating thermodynamic instability of the Ti\u2082Al\u2083 stoichiometry.\n\n**Threshold application (\u03b8):**\n- For existential claims: One credible DFT prediction OR thermodynamic evidence of phase stability would support the claim\n- Observed: Zero instances of either\n- The claim does not clear the threshold for \"predicted theoretically\" or \"phase exists\"\n\n**Confidence:** High. The convergence of negative evidence from independent sources (literature + thermodynamics) is compelling. While metastable phases can be database-incomplete, the complete absence of DFT predictions for a \"predicted\" phase is a critical failure.\n\n### 9. Sanity/Consistency Checks\n\n\u2713 **Units round-trip:** Phase fractions (0-1), temperature (K), composition (at.%) all consistent\n\u2713 **Baseline match:** Search found known Ti-Al phases; CALPHAD reproduced expected phase behavior\n\u2713 **Proxy disclosure:** No proxies used; direct evaluation of phase existence\n\u2713 **Score-narrative agreement:** Score of 1/5 matches \"not supported by literature or thermodynamics\"\n\u2713 **Scope fidelity:** Evaluated exact composition (Ti\u2082Al\u2083) and relevant temperature range\n\u2713 **Tool representation:** CALPHAD represents Ti-Al system; search accessed materials literature\n\u2713 **Metric-term mapping:** Evaluated phase existence (primary claim) and DFT prediction (stated basis)\n\n### 10. What Would Change the Score\n\n**To increase confidence in the claim:**\n1. **Published DFT study** predicting tetragonal Ti\u2082Al\u2083 with:\n   - Formation energy calculations showing metastability window\n   - Structural parameters (lattice constants, atomic positions)\n   - Comparison to competing phases\n   \n2. **Experimental synthesis** demonstrating:\n   - XRD confirmation of tetragonal structure at Ti\u2082Al\u2083 composition\n   - TEM characterization of precipitate structure\n   - Composition verification via EDS/EELS\n\n3. **Advanced computational evidence:**\n   - Metastable phase search using evolutionary algorithms\n   - Kinetic accessibility calculations (nucleation barriers, growth kinetics)\n   - Finite-temperature stability (phonons, free energy)\n\n4. **Database verification:**\n   - Confirmation that COST507R lacks metastable Ti-Al phases\n   - Alternative CALPHAD database showing Ti\u2082Al\u2083 phase\n   - Ab initio phase diagram calculations\n\n**Current status:** The claim rests on an unverified DFT prediction and a phase that does not appear in thermodynamic databases. Without either foundation, the claim cannot be supported.",
  "answer": "**CLAIM VERIFICATION: NOT SUPPORTED (Score: 1/5)**\n\nThe claim that \"a novel lightweight alloy is strengthened by precipitates of a novel metastable phase consistent with a tetragonal Ti\u2082Al\u2083 structure that has been predicted theoretically using density functional theory\" is **not supported** by available evidence.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1. **No DFT Prediction Found:** Three systematic literature searches found zero evidence of density functional theory predictions for a tetragonal Ti\u2082Al\u2083 phase. The Ti-Al system is extensively studied, making this absence significant.\n\n2. **No Thermodynamic Basis:** CALPHAD calculations at Ti\u2082Al\u2083 composition (40 at.% Ti, 60 at.% Al) show the system forms a two-phase mixture of TiAl + Al\u2082Ti (300-1260 K) or single-phase TiAl (1260-1500 K). No Ti\u2082Al\u2083 phase exists in the equilibrium database, and the composition's tendency to phase-separate suggests thermodynamic instability.\n\n3. **Known Ti-Al Phases:** Literature confirms Ti\u2083Al, TiAl, and TiAl\u2083 as documented phases, but Ti\u2082Al\u2083 is not among them.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim fails on both its stated basis (\"predicted theoretically using DFT\") and its implied thermodynamic plausibility. While metastable phases can be absent from databases, the complete lack of DFT predictions for a phase claimed to be \"predicted theoretically\" is a critical inconsistency. The evidence strongly suggests this phase has not been predicted or observed."
