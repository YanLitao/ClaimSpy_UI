  "reasoning": "- Call: \u20132 (Infeasible) because, at the stated composition (33.3 wt% each Mg/Al/Li) and operating temperature (450\u00b0C), CALPHAD shows the alloy is predominantly liquid (\u224889% liquid) with a liquidus near 292\u00b0C, a fatal contradiction for any structural, precipitation-strengthened sheet claim.\n- Claim minima that must all hold:\n  1) Equal\u2011wt% Mg\u2013Al\u2013Li can be cold\u2011rolled and precipitation hardened into a solid sheet.\n  2) The sheet remains solid and structurally stable up to 450\u00b0C at ambient pressure.\n  3) AlLi precipitates exist and pin grain boundaries to resist grain growth/creep at 450\u00b0C.\n  4) Weight is reduced vs 7000\u2011series Al (density advantage).\n- Evidence mapping:\n  - Direct/authoritative (phase stability): CALPHAD (COST507R) at the exact composition and 450\u00b0C \u2192 Liquid \u2248 0.8938, AlLi \u2248 0.1062; liquidus \u2248 292\u00b0C. This directly contradicts 1\u20133 at the stated temperature (no solid grain structure to pin; no structural integrity).\n  - Indirect/plausible: Density advantage vs 7000 series is directionally true but irrelevant if the alloy is molten at service temperature.\n- Why not \u20131/0/+1/+2:\n  - Not \u20131: The obstacle is fundamental (thermodynamic phase state), not parametric scope drift.\n  - Not 0: Evidence is decisive and condition\u2011matched; no ambiguity about being above liquidus.\n  - Not +1/+2: Core feasibility (solid at 450\u00b0C) fails; precipitation/creep resistance claims cannot apply in a predominantly liquid state.\n- Assumptions/limits: Uses equal weight percents as stated; sustained operating temperature at 450\u00b0C; CALPHAD uncertainty (\u00b110\u201320\u00b0C liquidus) cannot bridge a >150\u00b0C gap above liquidus.",
