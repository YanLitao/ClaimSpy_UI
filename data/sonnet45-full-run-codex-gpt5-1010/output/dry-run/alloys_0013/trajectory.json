This is a **complete failure** of the fundamental feasibility requirement.\n\n## Evidence Summary\n\n**Setup:** 33.3 wt% Mg, 33.3 wt% Al, 33.3 wt% Li evaluated from 25\u00b0C to 500\u00b0C using CALPHAD (COST507R database)\n\n**Raw Output at 450\u00b0C:**\n- Liquid phase fraction: 0.8938 (89.38%)\n- AlLi phase fraction: 0.1062 (10.62%)\n- Liquidus temperature: 292\u00b0C (565 K)\n\n**Interpretation:**\nThe alloy begins melting at 292\u00b0C and is almost completely liquid by 450\u00b0C. A structural material that is 89% molten cannot:\n1. Maintain structural integrity\n2. Resist creep (it's flowing as a liquid)\n3. Function as an aircraft skin\n4. Be cold-rolled into sheets in any practical sense at operating temperature\n\n**Scope check:** \u2713 In-scope - exact composition and temperature from claim\n**Uncertainty:** CALPHAD predictions for liquidus are typically accurate to \u00b110-20\u00b0C for well-characterized systems. Even with maximum uncertainty, the alloy would still be substantially molten at 450\u00b0C.\n\n## Synthesis\n\nThe claim asserts this alloy can \"function closer to the leading edges of supersonic aircraft wings and missile fins\" at \"operating temperatures as high as 450\u00b0C.\" However:\n\n1. **Phase stability failure:** The alloy is 89% liquid at 450\u00b0C, far above its liquidus of 292\u00b0C\n2. **Structural impossibility:** A predominantly molten material cannot bear structural loads\n3. **Processing contradiction:** While AlLi precipitates do form (10.6% at 450\u00b0C), they exist in a liquid matrix, not a solid one\n\nThe claim's assertion about high-temperature performance is **thermodynamically infeasible** for this specific composition.\n\n**Note on weight reduction:** The density advantage likely exists (Mg-Al-Li alloys are indeed very light), but this is irrelevant when the alloy cannot function as a solid structural material at the claimed temperature.\n\n## Stop Rule Triggered\n\nPer the pre-flight stop rules: \"If the alloy is liquid or predominantly liquid at 450\u00b0C \u2192 claim fails (cannot function structurally)\"\n\nThis condition is met. The alloy is 89.38% liquid at 450\u00b0C.

  "reasoning": "Following the claim verification guideline, I conducted a systematic pre-flight analysis and executed a minimal decisive test plan.\n\n**Pre-Flight Analysis:**\nThe claim asserts that a ternary Mg-Al-Li alloy (equal weight percentages: 33.3 wt% each) can function as aircraft skin material at temperatures up to 450\u00b0C after cold rolling and precipitation hardening. The core testable assertions are:\n1. Weight reduction vs 7000-series Al alloys (density advantage)\n2. Structural stability at 450\u00b0C\n3. AlLi precipitate formation for grain boundary pinning\n\n**Critical Feasibility Test:**\nUsing CALPHAD (COST507R database), I evaluated the phase equilibria of the exact composition (33.3 wt% Mg, 33.3 wt% Al, 33.3 wt% Li) across the temperature range 25-500\u00b0C.\n\n**Decisive Finding:**\nAt 450\u00b0C, the alloy composition exhibits:\n- **Liquid phase: 89.38%**\n- **AlLi intermetallic: 10.62%**\n- **Liquidus temperature: 292\u00b0C**\n\nThe alloy is predominantly molten at the claimed operating temperature, having exceeded its liquidus by 158\u00b0C.\n\n**Stop Rule Application:**\nPer the pre-flight stop rules: \"If the alloy is liquid or predominantly liquid at 450\u00b0C \u2192 claim fails (cannot function structurally).\" This condition is definitively met.\n\n**Scope and Uncertainty:**\n- The evaluation used the exact composition and temperature specified in the claim (in-scope: \u2713)\n- CALPHAD liquidus predictions are typically accurate to \u00b110-20\u00b0C for well-characterized systems\n- Even accounting for maximum database uncertainty, the alloy remains substantially molten at 450\u00b0C\n\n**Why This Invalidates the Claim:**\nA structural material that is 89% liquid cannot:\n1. Maintain dimensional stability or bear loads\n2. Function as aircraft skin\n3. Resist creep (the material is flowing as a liquid)\n4. Be meaningfully described as \"cold-rolled sheets\" at operating temperature\n\nWhile the claim's assertion about weight reduction is likely valid (Mg-Al-Li alloys are indeed very light, with rule-of-mixtures suggesting ~1.06 g/cm\u00b3 vs ~2.77 g/cm\u00b3 for 7000-series), this advantage is irrelevant when the material cannot exist as a solid structural component at the claimed service temperature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim is thermodynamically infeasible as stated.

Scope Lock\n- **System:** Ternary Mg-Al-Li alloy at 33.3 wt% each component\n- **State:** Cold-rolled sheet, precipitation-hardened\n- **Conditions:** Operating temperature up to 450\u00b0C, ambient pressure\n- **Manipulation:** Cold rolling followed by precipitation hardening treatment\n- **Measurement context:** Structural application as aircraft skin material\n- **Constraints:** Must remain solid and structurally stable at 450\u00b0C\n\n## 3. Evaluation Type\nUniversal claim (\"allowing this new alloy to also function\") - implies consistent structural performance at stated conditions.\n\n## 4. Target FoM & Units\n- **Primary:** Phase stability at 450\u00b0C (liquid fraction = 0 required for structural function)\n- **Secondary:** Density (g/cm\u00b3) for weight comparison vs 7000-series (~2.77 g/cm\u00b3)\n- **Tertiary:** Presence of AlLi precipitate phases\n\n## 5. Plan\n1. Search: Establish 7000-series baseline density\n2. CALPHAD: Evaluate phase equilibria for 33.3Mg-33.3Al-33.3Li (wt%) from 25-500\u00b0C\n   - Determine phases present at 450\u00b0C\n   - Calculate liquid fraction at 450\u00b0C\n   - Identify liquidus temperature\n   - Verify AlLi phase presence\n\n## 6. Evidence Table\n\n| Setup | Tool | Raw Output | FoM | Uncertainty | In-Scope |\n|-------|------|------------|-----|-------------|----------|\n| 33.3Mg-33.3Al-33.3Li wt%, 450\u00b0C, 1 bar | CALPHAD (COST507R) | Liquid: 0.8938, AlLi: 0.1062 | Liquid fraction: 89.38% | \u00b12-5% (database) | \u2713 |\n| Same composition, liquidus | CALPHAD | T_liquidus = 565.15 K | 292\u00b0C | \u00b110-20\u00b0C | \u2713 |\n| 7000-series baseline | Search | Density range | 2.72-2.81 g/cm\u00b3 | \u00b10.02 g/cm\u00b3 | \u2713 |\n\n## 7. Synthesis\nThe CALPHAD analysis reveals that at 450\u00b0C, the alloy is **89.38% liquid** with a liquidus temperature of only 292\u00b0C. The alloy exceeds its melting point by 158\u00b0C at the claimed operating temperature.\n\n**Direction:** The claim asserts solid-state structural function; reality shows predominantly molten state.\n\n**Magnitude:** 89.38% liquid vs 0% liquid required for structural integrity - this is a categorical failure, not a marginal deviation.\n\n**AlLi precipitates:** While AlLi phase is present (10.62%), it exists suspended in a liquid matrix, rendering the precipitation hardening mechanism irrelevant for structural applications.\n\n**Weight advantage:** Likely valid but immaterial - a molten material cannot function as aircraft skin regardless of density.\n\n## 8. Score & Rationale\n**INFEASIBLE**\n\nThe alloy composition specified (equal weight percentages of Mg, Al, and Li) is thermodynamically incapable of functioning as a structural material at 450\u00b0C. With a liquidus temperature of 292\u00b0C, the alloy is predominantly molten (89% liquid) at the claimed operating temperature. A liquid cannot:\n- Maintain structural integrity as aircraft skin\n- Be meaningfully cold-rolled at operating temperature\n- Resist creep through grain boundary pinning (no grain boundaries exist in liquid)\n\nThis is a fundamental thermodynamic impossibility that invalidates the claim regardless of any weight advantages. The threshold for structural function (liquid fraction = 0) is violated by 89 percentage points.\n\n## 9. Sanity/Consistency Checks\n\u2713 Units: Temperature in \u00b0C, phase fractions dimensionless, density in g/cm\u00b3\n\u2713 Composition: 33.3 wt% each component matches \"equal weight percentages\"\n\u2713 Temperature: 450\u00b0C evaluated as stated in claim\n\u2713 Baseline: 7000-series density (2.72-2.81 g/cm\u00b3) consistent with literature\n\u2713 Score-narrative agreement: INFEASIBLE verdict matches 89% liquid finding\n\u2713 Stop rule: \"Predominantly liquid at 450\u00b0C\" condition met - analysis terminated appropriately\n\n## 10. What Would Change the Score\n- **Different composition:** A Mg-Al-Li alloy with higher Al content and lower Li content might have liquidus >450\u00b0C\n- **Different temperature:** If claim specified 200-250\u00b0C operating temperature, alloy would be solid\n- **Database error:** Evidence that COST507R severely misrepresents Mg-Al-Li liquidus (unlikely - constituent binaries are well-characterized)\n- **Reinterpretation:** If \"450\u00b0C\" referred to a brief transient rather than sustained operating temperature (but claim states \"operating temperatures as high as 450C\")\n\nThe claim as stated is definitively infeasible due to thermodynamic constraints."
