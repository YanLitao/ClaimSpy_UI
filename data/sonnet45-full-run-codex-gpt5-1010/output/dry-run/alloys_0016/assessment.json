This composition meets the conventional \u226595% threshold for a 'single phase' designation while accommodating the minor precipitate phase mentioned in the claim. The apparent contradiction in terminology ('single phase' with 'precipitates') is resolved by interpreting this as a dominant matrix phase with secondary precipitates, which is standard in precipitation-hardened alloys.",
