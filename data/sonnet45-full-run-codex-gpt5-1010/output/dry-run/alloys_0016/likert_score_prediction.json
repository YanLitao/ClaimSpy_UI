  "reasoning": "+2 (Feasible) because the key elements of the existential claim are supported by condition\u2011matched experimental evidence: room\u2011temperature yield strength >1 GPa is directly reported (~1.12 GPa), and long\u2011term structural robustness at 800 C is documented (10,000 h with minimal degradation). CALPHAD indicates a Cu\u2011rich FCC matrix with minor secondary phase at RT, consistent with a \u201csingle\u2011phase matrix with complexion\u2011stabilized precipitates,\u201d and any equilibrium dissolution at high T is plausibly offset by kinetic/complexion stabilization observed experimentally.\n\nMinimum elements that must simultaneously hold:\n- Existence of a Cu\u20113Ta\u20110.5Li (at%) alloy sample prepared.\n- Matrix/phase constitution at RT: dominant single FCC Cu\u2011rich matrix with minor precipitates (interpretation of \u201csingle phase with precipitates\u201d as a single\u2011phase matrix plus secondary particles).\n- Structural robustness maintained up to 800 C.\n- Room\u2011temperature yield strength exceeding 1 GPa.\n\nEvidence mapping:\n- Direct (matching conditions): RT yield strength ~1.12 GPa; 800 C long\u2011term stability (10,000 h) with maintained properties/creep resistance.\n- Indirect/proxy: CALPHAD shows ~96% FCC_A1 + ~4% B2 at RT (supports dominant single\u2011phase matrix with precipitates); equilibrium dissolution of B2 by ~815 K, but does not preclude kinetically stabilized complexions/precipitates.\n- Contradictions: Equilibrium prediction of precipitate dissolution at elevated T; outweighed by direct experimental stability data under the stated high\u2011T condition.\n\nWhy not other scores:\n- Not \u20132/\u20131: No fundamental contradiction; strength level and high\u2011T stability are within known behavior for Cu\u2011Ta systems with nanoscale/complexion stabilization.\n- Not 0: Conditions and metrics are specified; direct property/stability measurements resolve feasibility.\n- +1 vs +2: All critical elements (composition, RT strength >1 GPa, robustness at 800 C) are evidenced under matching conditions; modeling provides consistent phase context, supporting +2.\n\nAssumptions/limitations:\n- \u201cSingle phase with precipitates\u201d interpreted as a majority single\u2011phase matrix containing precipitates.\n- CALPHAD/database identity and literature claims are taken at face value; detailed microstructural (TEM/in\u2011situ) confirmation would further strengthen the case but is not essential for feasibility.",
