This is plausible for a solid solution or intermetallic phase.\n\nNow I'll proceed with CALPHAD to check phase stability.",

  "reasoning": "Following the claim verification guideline, I conducted a systematic pre-flight analysis and executed a minimal decisive test plan.\n\n**Pre-Flight Analysis:**\nThe claim asserts an \"unprecedented combination\" of low density (2.4 g/cm\u00b3) and high specific yield strength (344,000 N\u00b7m/kg = 344 MPa\u00b7cm\u00b3/g) in a \"stable, single-phase material\" with composition Al55Mg35Li5Zn5. I established that:\n- \"Single-phase\" requires \u226595% phase fraction (domain standard)\n- This is an existential claim (\"has been obtained\")\n- Two FoMs must be verified: density and specific yield strength\n- The single-phase requirement is a core, testable aspect\n\n**Density Sanity Check:**\nUsing rule-of-mixtures with elemental densities (Al: 2.70, Mg: 1.74, Li: 0.534, Zn: 7.14 g/cm\u00b3), I calculated an expected density of ~2.39 g/cm\u00b3, which matches the claimed 2.4 g/cm\u00b3 within measurement uncertainty. This aspect is plausible.\n\n**Phase Stability Assessment (CALPHAD):**\nThe CALPHAD calculation using the COST 507 database definitively showed that Al55Mg35Li5Zn5 is **NOT single-phase** across 300-800 K:\n- Dominant phase: ALMG_BETA (84-88 mol%)\n- Secondary phase: ALLI (10-11 mol%)\n- Minor phases: PHI or ALMG_GAMMA (1-5%)\n\nThe secondary phase ALLI at 10-11% far exceeds the 5% threshold for \"single-phase\" classification.

No further tool calls are needed.\n\n**What Was Not Tested:**\nThe mechanical properties (specific yield strength) were not computationally verified because:\n1. CALPHAD cannot predict mechanical properties\n2. CHGNet cannot reliably predict yield strength\n3. The phase stability failure already refutes the claim\n4. Testing mechanical properties of a multi-phase material would be out-of-scope for the stated claim",
  "answer": "# Claim Verification Report: alloys_0007\n\n## 1. Claim (Verbatim)\n\"An unprecedented combination of low density, 2.4 g/cm^3, and high specific yield strength, 344000 N*m/kg, has been obtained by processing normally-brittle intermetallics with aluminum at high temperature and pressure to form a stable, single-phase material with composition Al55Mg35Li5Zn5.\"\n\n## 2. Scope Lock\n- **System:** Al55Mg35Li5Zn5 quaternary alloy (atomic percent)\n- **State/Phase:** Claimed to be single-phase solid\n- **Conditions:** High temperature and pressure processing (specific values not stated; evaluated 300-800 K at 1 bar)\n- **Manipulation:** Processing of intermetallics with aluminum\n- **Constraints:** Must be \u226595% single phase; density = 2.4 \u00b1 0.1 g/cm\u00b3; specific yield strength = 344,000 \u00b1 34,400 N\u00b7m/kg\n\n## 3. Evaluation Type\nExistential claim (\"has been obtained\") - requires verification that the stated property combination can exist under the specified conditions.\n\n## 4. Target FoM & Units\n- **Density (\u03c1):** 2.4 g/cm\u00b3\n- **Specific yield strength (\u03c3_y/\u03c1):** 344,000 N\u00b7m/kg = 344 MPa\u00b7cm\u00b3/g\n- **Phase purity:** Single-phase (\u226595% of one phase)\n\n## 5. Plan\n1. Density sanity check via rule-of-mixtures calculation\n2. CALPHAD phase stability assessment at Al55Mg35Li5Zn5 composition (300-800 K)\n3. Stop if single-phase requirement fails (decisive refutation)\n\n## 6. Evidence Table\n\n| Test | Setup | Raw Output | Converted FoM | Uncertainty | In-Scope |\n|------|-------|------------|---------------|-------------|----------|\n| Density (rule-of-mixtures) | Al55Mg35Li5Zn5, elemental densities | 1/\u03c1 = 0.418 cm\u00b3/g | \u03c1 = 2.39 g/cm\u00b3 | \u00b10.05 g/cm\u00b3 (estimate) | \u2713 |\n| CALPHAD phase stability | Al55Mg35Li5Zn5, 300-800 K, 1 bar, COST507 TDB | ALMG_BETA: 84-88%, ALLI: 10-11%, minor phases: 1-5% | Multi-phase (max 88% single phase) | \u00b12% (typical CALPHAD) | \u2713 |\n\n## 7. Synthesis\n**Density:** The calculated density (2.39 g/cm\u00b3) agrees with the claimed value (2.4 g/cm\u00b3) within uncertainty. This aspect is **plausible**.\n\n**Phase Stability:** CALPHAD unambiguously shows the composition is **multi-phase** across the evaluated temperature range. The dominant phase (ALMG_BETA) reaches only 84-88%, with a persistent secondary phase (ALLI) at 10-11%. This fails the \u226595% single-phase criterion by a large margin (>5% secondary phase).\n\n**Mechanical Properties:** Not evaluated computationally (tools cannot reliably predict yield strength). However, this is moot because the phase stability requirement has failed.\n\n**Out-of-scope consideration:** High-pressure processing might alter phase stability, but the claim states the material is \"stable\" (implying thermodynamic stability), and no specific pressure was provided for evaluation. Standard CALPHAD at 1 bar is the appropriate baseline.\n\n## 8. Score & Rationale\n**Score: INFEASIBLE**\n\nThe claim is **refuted** because the composition Al55Mg35Li5Zn5 cannot form a \"stable, single-phase material\" as explicitly required. CALPHAD calculations using a validated thermodynamic database (COST 507) show the alloy is consistently two-phase with 10-11% secondary phase (ALLI) across 300-800 K. This exceeds the 5% threshold for single-phase classification by more than a factor of two. The single-phase requirement is a core, non-negotiable aspect of the claim, and its failure constitutes a definitive refutation regardless of whether the density or mechanical properties are achievable.\n\n## 9. Sanity/Consistency Checks\n- \u2713 Units: Density in g/cm\u00b3, specific strength converted correctly to MPa\u00b7cm\u00b3/g\n- \u2713 Baseline: Rule-of-mixtures density (2.39 g/cm\u00b3) matches claim (2.4 g/cm\u00b3)\n- \u2713 Tool representation: CALPHAD appropriate for phase stability; cannot assess mechanical properties (acknowledged)\n- \u2713 Scope fidelity: Evaluated exact composition at reasonable temperature range\n- \u2713 Score-narrative agreement: INFEASIBLE verdict matches multi-phase finding\n- \u26a0 Proxy disclosure: Mechanical properties not evaluated (no suitable computational method)\n\n## 10. What Would Change the Score\n- **Experimental evidence** showing single-phase XRD pattern at this exact composition after high-T/P processing\n- **Alternative thermodynamic database** predicting single-phase stability (would require validation against experimental data)\n- **Clarification** that \"single-phase\" was mislabeled and the claim actually refers to a two-phase material (would require claim revision)\n- **High-pressure phase diagram data** showing pressure-induced single-phase stability (claim did not specify pressure value for evaluation)\n\nThe mechanical property claims (density, specific strength) remain unverified but are secondary to the phase stability failure."
