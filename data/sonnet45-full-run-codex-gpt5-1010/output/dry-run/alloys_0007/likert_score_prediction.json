  "reasoning": "-2 (Infeasible) because authoritative thermodynamic evidence contradicts the core \u201cstable, single-phase\u201d requirement at the stated composition. CALPHAD (appropriate for phase stability) predicts persistent two-phase equilibria (\u224884\u201388% ALMG_BETA + 10\u201311% ALLI, plus minor phases) across 300\u2013800 K at 1 bar, exceeding the \u226595% single-phase threshold. While the density is plausible by rule-of-mixtures (\u22482.39 g/cm\u00b3 \u2248 2.4 g/cm\u00b3), the single-phase criterion fails decisively; mechanical property verification is moot once phase stability fails.\n\nClaim decomposition (minima that must all hold):\n- A stable, single-phase solid exists at Al55Mg35Li5Zn5 (\u226595% single phase under implicit standard conditions).\n- Density \u2248 2.4 g/cm\u00b3.\n- Specific yield strength \u2248 344,000 N\u00b7m/kg.\n\nEvidence mapping:\n- Thermodynamics/phase (direct, condition-matched): CALPHAD (COST 507 TDB) \u2192 multiphase with 10\u201311% ALLI across 300\u2013800 K at 1 bar \u2192 contradicts single-phase requirement.\n- Density (proxy sanity check): rule-of-mixtures \u2192 2.39 g/cm\u00b3 \u2192 supports density plausibility.\n- Mechanical property: not evaluated; unnecessary given failed phase requirement.\n\nWhy not other Likert values:\n- Not \u20131: This is not a minor window/scope mismatch; it\u2019s a fundamental phase-stability contradiction at baseline conditions.\n- Not 0: Evidence is not balanced/insufficient; it directly contradicts a core element.\n- Not +1/+2: The necessary single-phase existence is not met; property claims cannot rescue the failed phase criterion.\n\nAssumptions/limitations:\n- Interprets \u201cstable\u201d and unspecified pressure as ambient stability unless otherwise stated; if single-phase exists only under sustained high pressure, the claim should specify it. \n- Relies on COST 507 database fidelity; would reconsider if validated experimental/high-pressure data showed single-phase stability at this exact composition.",
