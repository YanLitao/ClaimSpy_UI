  "reasoning": "-2 (Infeasible) because the high-temperature strength component contradicts well-established behavior of Al-based alloys near their melting point. The claim\u2019s minima are: (i) Al\u20132 wt% Be composition, (ii) density \u22482.7 g/cc, (iii) room-temperature UTS = 500 MPa, and (iv) UTS = 50 MPa at 650\u00b0C. Evidence mapping: density is supported by rule-of-mixtures (~2.68 g/cc); 500 MPa RT UTS is plausible for high-strength Al (though unverified for Al\u2013Be specifically); however, at 650\u00b0C (~0.99 Tm of Al), Al alloys exhibit near-zero tensile strength due to precipitate dissolution, grain-boundary sliding, and incipient/eutectic melting\u2014standard tensile UTS values this close to melting are not sustained. This is a fatal condition/property mismatch, not just an optimistic number. Thus the claim as stated fails on fundamental grounds despite the density and RT strength being plausible.",
