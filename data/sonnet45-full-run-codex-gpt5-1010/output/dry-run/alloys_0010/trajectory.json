Ultimate tensile strength (UTS) at room temperature = 500 MPa\n2. Density (\u03c1) = 2.7 g/cc\n3. Ultimate tensile strength at 650\u00b0C = 50 MPa\n**Quantifier:** Existential (\"has been created\" \u2192 \"can exist\" / \"there exists\")\n**Threshold \u03b8:** For existential claims, we need evidence that such properties are achievable within \u00b110% (accounting for measurement uncertainty and processing variations). Specifically:\n- UTS_RT: 450-550 MPa\n- Density: 2.65-2.75 g/cc\n- UTS_650C: 45-55 MPa\n</ClaimCard>\n\n<VerbMapping>\n\"has been created\" \u2192 existential claim. We need to verify technical plausibility that an Al-2wt%Be alloy can exhibit these three properties simultaneously. This does NOT require finding a specific paper announcing this discovery, but rather verifying that the stated properties are physically reasonable and achievable for this composition.\n</VerbMapping>\n\n<MetricIntegrity>\nThe claim specifies three distinct FoMs:\n1. **UTS at RT** - direct mechanical property\n2. **Density** - thermophysical property\n3. **UTS at 650\u00b0C** - high-temperature mechanical property\n\nAll three are standard, well-defined materials properties. No proxies are needed. Density can be calculated from composition and crystal structure. Mechanical properties (UTS) require either experimental data or are out-of-scope for computational thermodynamics tools like CALPHAD (which addresses phase stability, not mechanical properties).\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\n**CALPHAD:** Can address phase stability and equilibrium phases at both RT and 650\u00b0C for Al-2wt%Be. Can provide density estimates if phase fractions and lattice parameters are available. **Cannot** directly predict UTS values.\n\n**CHGNet MLIP:** Primarily for atomistic simulations, barriers, and energetics. **Not suitable** for predicting bulk mechanical properties like UTS, which depend on microstructure, grain size, precipitate distribution, work hardening, etc.\n\n**Search tool:** Can find:\n- Literature on Al-Be alloy properties\n- Typical UTS ranges for Al-Be alloys at various compositions\n- Density data for Al-Be system\n- High-temperature strength retention data\n\n**Assessment:** Mechanical properties (UTS) are **not directly represented** by CALPHAD or CHGNet. The density can be estimated via CALPHAD (phase fractions + lattice parameters). The primary verification path must rely on **search_tool** to find matched-condition experimental data or established property ranges for Al-2wt%Be alloys.\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n**Units:**\n- UTS: MPa (megapascals) - standard\n- Density: g/cc = g/cm\u00b3 - standard\n- Temperature: \u00b0C (will convert to K when needed: T(K) = T(\u00b0C) + 273.15)\n- Composition: wt% Be\n\n**Baseline checks:**\n- Pure Al density: ~2.70 g/cm\u00b3 at RT\n- Pure Be density: ~1.85 g/cm\u00b3 at RT\n- Rule of mixtures (rough): \u03c1_alloy \u2248 1/(w_Al/\u03c1_Al + w_Be/\u03c1_Be) = 1/(0.98/2.70 + 0.02/1.85) \u2248 2.68 g/cm\u00b3\n- The claimed 2.7 g/cc is very close to pure Al and slightly above the rule-of-mixtures estimate, which is reasonable.\n\n**Conversions:**\n- 1 MPa = 10\u2076 Pa\n- 1 g/cc = 1000 kg/m\u00b3\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\nSince this is an **existential claim** about three properties, we need evidence that:\n1. Al-2wt%Be alloys can achieve UTS ~500 MPa at RT\n2. The density is consistent with ~2.7 g/cc\n3. High-temperature strength at 650\u00b0C can be ~50 MPa\n\n**Stop rules:**\n- If literature shows Al-2wt%Be alloys achieving these properties (within \u03b8), the claim is **Supported**.\n- If literature shows these properties are far outside known ranges for this composition, the claim is **Refuted**.\n- If no matched-condition data exists but properties are within reasonable bounds based on neighboring compositions or general Al-Be behavior, the claim is **Plausible but Unverified**.\n\n**Minimal test set:**\n1. **Search query 1:** Find Al-Be alloy property data, focusing on compositions near 2 wt% Be, including room-temperature and elevated-temperature mechanical properties.\n2. **Optional CALPHAD:** Verify phase stability at RT and 650\u00b0C, estimate density if needed for cross-check.\n3. **Stop** once sufficient evidence is gathered for existential verification.\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n## Tool Plan\n\n<ToolPlan>\n**Primary strategy:** Use **search_tool** to find experimental data on Al-Be alloys near 2 wt% Be composition.\n\n**Rationale:**\n- Mechanical properties (UTS) are not computable via CALPHAD or CHGNet in a meaningful way.\n- Density can be estimated, but the claimed value (2.7 g/cc) is already very close to pure Al and physically reasonable.\n- The critical unknowns are whether UTS values of 500 MPa (RT) and 50 MPa (650\u00b0C) are achievable.\n\n**Query plan:**\n1. **Query 1:** Search for \"Al-Be alloy mechanical properties tensile strength\" to establish general property ranges and find data on low-Be-content alloys.\n2. **Query 2 (if needed):** Search for \"Al-2wt%Be alloy properties\" or \"aluminum beryllium 2 percent\" for composition-specific data.\n3. **Query 3 (if needed):** Search for \"Al-Be alloy high temperature strength 650C\" if elevated-temperature data is sparse.\n\n**CALPHAD use (optional, cost 5):**\n- Only if search results are inconclusive and we need to verify phase stability or density as a cross-check.\n- **Likely unnecessary** given that density is already reasonable and phase stability is not the core question.\n\n**CHGNet use:**\n- **Not planned.** UTS is a bulk mechanical property outside the scope of atomistic MLIP simulations.\n\n**Expected outcome:** One or two well-targeted search queries should provide sufficient evidence to assess the plausibility of the claimed properties.\n</ToolPlan>\n\n## Execution Plan\n\nI will start with **search_tool** to gather experimental data on Al-Be alloys. Given the tool policy, I will use a single, well-crafted query first and evaluate whether additional queries are needed.\n\n**First query:** Broad search on Al-Be alloy mechanical properties to establish context and find relevant composition ranges.",

AlBeMet162 is an established Al-Be alloy with documented mechanical properties\n2. The sources show temperature-dependent tensile strength behavior\n3. However, these sources focus on **cryogenic temperatures** (-195.5\u00b0C to -252.8\u00b0C), not room temperature or 650\u00b0C\n\n**Critical gap:** I need to find:\n- The **composition** of AlBeMet162 (is it close to 2 wt% Be?)\n- Room temperature UTS values for Al-Be alloys\n- High-temperature (650\u00b0C) strength data\n\n**Analysis of AlBeMet162:**\nFrom my knowledge, AlBeMet162 is typically a higher-Be-content alloy (around 62 wt% Be, hence the \"162\" designation likely refers to 62% Be). This is **far from** the claimed 2 wt% Be composition. So while these results confirm Al-Be alloys exist with documented properties, they are not matched-condition data for our claim.\n\n**Revised assessment:**\n- The claim specifies **2 wt% Be**, which is a **very low** beryllium content\n- AlBeMet alloys are typically much higher in Be content (40-65 wt% Be)\n- Low-Be Al alloys (2 wt%) would behave more like aluminum alloys with minor alloying additions\n\n**Next steps:**\nI should use my third and final search query to specifically target:\n1. Low-Be-content aluminum alloys (1-5 wt% range)\n2. Room temperature and elevated temperature properties\n3.

  "answer": "**REFUTED**\n\nThe claim is refuted on physical grounds. While the density (2.7 g/cc) is consistent with the composition and the room-temperature UTS (500 MPa) is plausible for a high-strength aluminum alloy, the claim of 50 MPa tensile strength at 650\u00b0C is physically implausible. At 650\u00b0C, the alloy is operating at 98.9% of aluminum's melting point (660.3\u00b0C), where aluminum-based alloys experience severe weakening due to high diffusion rates, grain boundary sliding, and proximity to incipient melting. Literature confirms that aluminum alloys lose significant strength above 300\u00b0C, and commercial Al-Be alloys are rated only to 150\u00b0C. The high-temperature strength claim contradicts fundamental thermophysical behavior of aluminum alloys."
