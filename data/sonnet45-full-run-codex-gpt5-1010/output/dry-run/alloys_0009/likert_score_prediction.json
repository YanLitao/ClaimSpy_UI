  "reasoning": "\u20132 (Infeasible) because 700\u00b0C exceeds the aluminum solidus, making solid\u2011state superplastic forming of an Al\u2011containing sheet fundamentally impossible as stated.\n\nClaim decomposition (minima that must all hold):\n- Material: AlBeMet sheet (Al\u2013Be composite), 0.050 in thick, intact sheet.\n- Process/conditions: Superplastic forming (solid\u2011state, grain\u2011boundary sliding) at 700\u00b0C.\n- Outcome: A formed 12\u2011inch parabolic dish.\n\nEvidence/constraints:\n- Superplastic forming of Al alloys is typically 450\u2013520\u00b0C; Al\u2011matrix composites may extend to ~560\u2013580\u00b0C, but must remain below the alloy\u2019s solidus.\n- Pure Al melts at ~660\u00b0C. In Al\u2013Be systems, the Al\u2011rich solidus is not above 660\u00b0C and may be lowered by eutectic reactions; AlBeMet contains substantial aluminum (commonly an Al\u2011rich matrix/interface phases).\n- SPF requires the sheet to remain solid; at 700\u00b0C an Al\u2011containing matrix would be partially/fully molten, leading to semisolid/liquid behavior rather than SPF and loss of sheet integrity.\n\nWhy not other scores:\n- Not \u20131: The obstacle is fundamental (solidus exceeded), not a tunable parameter window.\n- Not 0: Conditions are explicit; the temperature conflicts with basic thermodynamics.\n- Not +1/+2: No feasible SPF at 700\u00b0C for an Al\u2011bearing sheet; geometry/thickness are moot if the material cannot remain solid.\n\nAssumptions/limits:\n- Assumes AlBeMet has an Al\u2011rich phase with solidus \u2264 ~660\u00b0C, as in standard Al\u2013Be composites. If a specific Be\u2011rich intermetallic variant with a verified solidus >700\u00b0C and demonstrated superplasticity existed, this judgment could change, but such evidence is not provided.",
