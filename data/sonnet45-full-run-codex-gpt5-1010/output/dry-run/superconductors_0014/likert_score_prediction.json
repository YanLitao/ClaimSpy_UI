  "reasoning": "+2 (Feasible) because the process combines established elements: water-immersion lithography (water between lens and resist) is a proven resolution-enhancement method via increased numerical aperture; immersion-compatible resists/topcoats are well-documented; Al thin films are routinely patterned by photoresist/etch flows and retain superconductivity (Tc \u2248 1.2 K) after standard processing. Water interfaces with the resist (not bare Al) during exposure, and known mitigations (topcoats, resist formulations, post-cleans) address leaching/oxidation concerns, so integration is technically sound.\n\nMinima that must hold:\n- Water immersion between the final lens and resist increases patterning resolution (optical mechanism).\n- A water-compatible (novel) photoresist/topcoat stack can be used on Al films.\n- Pattern transfer to Al via etching is achievable without degrading film integrity.\n- Resulting Al traces remain superconducting at low T.\n\nEvidence mapping:\n- Direct/established: 193 nm immersion lithography with water (n\u22481.33) \u2192 resolution gain via higher NA; immersion resists/topcoats mitigate water interactions; Al superconducting circuits commonly made by lithography and etching with robust Tc.\n- Indirect but aligned: Process integration across these steps is standard in semiconductor and superconducting device fabrication; no fundamental incompatibility identified.\n- Contradictions: None fundamental; known issues (resist leaching, Al surface oxidation) have established remedies.\n\nWhy not other scores:\n- \u20132/\u20131: No phase, thermodynamic, or process incompatibility under stated conditions; issues are engineering, not fundamental.\n- 0: Not underspecified for direction\u2014each element has strong precedent.\n- +1: All necessary elements are already demonstrated in practice; the combination is within standard capabilities, so no critical missing piece remains.\n\nAssumptions/limitations:\n- Access to immersion-capable lithography and immersion-compatible resist/topcoat.\n- Proper post-pattern cleans and controlled etch to preserve Al superconductivity.",
