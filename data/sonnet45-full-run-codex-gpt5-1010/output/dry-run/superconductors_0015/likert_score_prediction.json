  "reasoning": "- \u20132 (Infeasible) because the claim, as written, requires melting niobium at 250\u00b0C, which is fundamentally impossible (Nb melts at 2477\u00b0C). Even under a charitable reinterpretation (Sn melts and wets solid Nb), there is no credible evidence that Nb3Sn forms at 250\u00b0C; reported formation temperatures are \u2265~435\u00b0C and typically much higher due to kinetic constraints.\n- Minima that must hold:\n  1) Both Nb and Sn powders are melted at 250\u00b0C by a laser. \n  2) Nb3Sn forms under these conditions. \n  3) The resulting traces are superconducting.\n- Evidence mapping:\n  - Direct contradiction: Nb melting point 2477\u00b0C \u2192 cannot melt at 250\u00b0C.\n  - Indirect/proxy: CALPHAD indicates Nb3Sn is thermodynamically stable at 250\u00b0C, but kinetics are limiting; diffusion at 250\u00b0C is too slow.\n  - Literature: Lowest reported Nb3Sn formation ~435\u00b0C; common processing requires substantially higher T.\n- Why not \u20131: The obstacle is fundamental (melting Nb at 250\u00b0C), not just an optimistic parameter range.\n- Why not 0/+1/+2: Evidence is not balanced or missing; it directly contradicts the claim\u2019s core condition. No matched-condition demonstration supports the process as stated.\n- Assumptions: Interprets \u201cmelted at 250\u00b0C\u201d literally; if lasers locally exceed 2477\u00b0C, the statement\u2019s conditions are misreported and still fail as written.",
