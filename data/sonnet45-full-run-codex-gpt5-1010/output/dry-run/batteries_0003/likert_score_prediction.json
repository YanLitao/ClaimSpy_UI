  "reasoning": "+2 (Feasible) because multiple peer\u2011reviewed demonstrations show functional fiber batteries assembled by twisting two wire/fiber electrodes into a cable-like architecture that the field often describes as coaxial/core\u2013sheath or twisted-pair fiber batteries. The minimal requirements\u2014two compatible wire electrodes, an intervening separator/gel electrolyte to prevent shorting, and stable electrochemical operation\u2014are all met in these reports. While \u201ccoaxial\u201d strictly implies concentric layering, the literature commonly applies the term to helical-wound/twisted core\u2013sheath assemblies; both true concentric and twisted implementations have been realized and operate as full cells.\n\nClaim decomposition (minima):\n- Twisting an anode wire and a cathode wire together with separator/electrolyte yields a functional fiber battery.\n- The resulting geometry (twisted/helical/core\u2013sheath) is accepted as a coaxial-style fiber architecture in the field.\n\nEvidence:\n- Direct (matching conditions): Published fiber batteries using twisted CNT yarn cathodes with metal/anode wires and gel separators; also \u201ccoaxial\u201d fiber batteries via winding one electrode around a core with separator, demonstrating charge\u2013discharge and flexibility.\n- Indirect/proxy: Mechanistic plausibility (separator prevents short; large contact area benefits).\n- Contradictions: None located.\n\nWhy not other scores:\n- Not \u20132/\u20131: No fundamental or parametric contradiction; numerous working devices exist.\n- Not 0/+1: Evidence is direct and condition\u2011matched for the existential \u201ccan be made\u201d claim.\n\nAssumptions/limitations:\n- \u201cCoaxial\u201d is interpreted in the conventional fiber\u2011device literature sense (core\u2013sheath/helical winding), and assumes inclusion of a separator/gel electrolyte between twisted electrodes.",
