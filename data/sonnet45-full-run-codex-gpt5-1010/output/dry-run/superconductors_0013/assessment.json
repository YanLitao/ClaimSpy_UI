This process is fundamentally infeasible due to severe temperature incompatibility: aluminum melts at approximately 660\u00b0C while water boils at 100\u00b0C at atmospheric pressure and reaches its critical point at 374\u00b0C, above which liquid water cannot exist.",

At aluminum's melting temperature, water would exist as steam or supercritical fluid, not as a stable liquid capable of optical lensing.

This actual technique works at room temperature using pre-deposited thin films (not powdered Al), with water acting as an adhesion mediator through capillary forces and interfacial bonding, not through melting or optical lensing.",

The real technique involves: (1) room-temperature operation, (2) transfer of pre-fabricated thin films from stamp to substrate, (3) water-mediated surface bonding for adhesion, and (4) no melting or optical effects. Resolution improvement comes from conformal contact and capillary forces, not from any lensing mechanism.",
