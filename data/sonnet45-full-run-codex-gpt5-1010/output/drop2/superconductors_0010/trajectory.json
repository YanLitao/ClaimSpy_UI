Threshold: ductility improvement detectable above measurement uncertainty (~0.1% strain units).\n  - For feasibility: successful formation of Nb\u2083Sn phase (A15 structure) in as-deposited or post-processed state.\n  - For geometry: ability to deposit in coiled/curved geometry without post-coiling.\n</ClaimCard>\n\n<VerbMapping>\n- \"was developed\" \u2192 existential claim: the method can exist and function\n- \"enabling\" \u2192 capability claim: the method can produce the stated outcome\n- \"more ductile\" \u2192 comparative improvement over baseline (conventional Nb\u2083Sn wires)\n- \"removes the need\" \u2192 eliminates a processing step (coiling after reaction)\n\nThe weakest testable criterion: Can DED produce Nb\u2083Sn on a dissolvable substrate, and does the resulting material show any ductility advantage or geometric flexibility advantage over conventional routes?\n</VerbMapping>\n\n<MetricIntegrity>\n**Core FoM:** Ductility of Nb\u2083Sn wires\n**Challenge:** The claim states \"more ductile\" but doesn't provide quantitative baseline or target values.\n\n**Proxy considerations:**\n- Nb\u2083Sn in A15 phase is inherently brittle (\u03b5_f ~ 0.2-0.5%)\n- \"More ductile\" could mean:\n  1. Higher strain tolerance than conventional Nb\u2083Sn (still brittle, but less so)\n  2. Retention of ductile Nb or Sn phases that haven't fully reacted\n  3. Microstructural refinement reducing crack sensitivity\n\n**Integrity issue:** Without access to mechanical testing data, I cannot directly measure ductility. Available tools:\n- CALPHAD: can predict phase equilibria (A15 vs other phases) but NOT mechanical properties\n- CHGNet: not applicable to this metallurgical processing claim\n- Search: can find literature on DED of Nb-Sn, ductility of Nb\u2083Sn, and NaCl substrate approaches\n\n**Decision:** This claim is primarily about **process feasibility** and **comparative mechanical properties**. Neither computational tool directly addresses the core FoM (ductility). The claim will need to be evaluated based on:\n1. Thermodynamic plausibility of forming Nb\u2083Sn via DED\n2. Literature evidence on DED of reactive metal systems\n3. Known ductility constraints of A15 Nb\u2083Sn\n4. Evidence of the specific NaCl substrate approach\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\n**CALPHAD (Nb-Sn system):**\n- Can represent: Phase equilibria, A15 Nb\u2083Sn stability region, composition-temperature relationships\n- Cannot represent: DED process kinetics, mechanical properties (ductility), substrate effects, powder processing\n\n**CHGNet:**\n- Not applicable: This is a metallurgical processing and mechanical property claim, not a diffusion barrier or atomic-scale kinetics problem\n\n**Search:**\n- Can find: Literature on DED of Nb-Sn, NaCl substrate methods, ductility data for Nb\u2083Sn, process feasibility reports\n- This is the primary tool for this claim\n\n**Verdict:** The computational tools (CALPHAD, CHGNet) are **OUT OF SCOPE** for the core claim. CALPHAD could verify that Nb\u2083Sn is thermodynamically stable, but this is already well-established and doesn't address the novel process or ductility claim. The claim must be evaluated via **search** for process feasibility and mechanical property evidence.\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n**Units:**\n- Ductility: strain-to-failure \u03b5_f (%), or elongation (%), or reduction in area (%)\n- Composition: atomic % or weight % (Nb\u2083Sn = 75 at.% Nb, 25 at.% Sn)\n- Temperature: K or \u00b0C (A15 forms below ~930\u00b0C in Nb-Sn)\n\n**Baseline:**\n- Conventional Nb\u2083Sn wires (bronze route or internal tin): \u03b5_f ~ 0.2-0.5% (very brittle)\n- Pure Nb: \u03b5_f ~ 20-30% (ductile)\n- Pure Sn: \u03b5_f ~ 40-50% (ductile)\n\n**Conversion checks:** Not applicable for this qualitative claim, but will verify any quantitative data found.\n\n**Baseline validation:** Will look for established ductility values of conventional Nb\u2083Sn to anchor \"more ductile\" comparison.\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n**Existential claim structure:** \"There exists a DED method using NaCl substrate that can produce Nb\u2083Sn wires with improved ductility in coiled geometry.\"\n\n**Decisive evidence (any ONE suffices for plausibility):**\n1. Published demonstration of DED Nb-Sn on dissolvable substrate\n2. Evidence that DED can produce Nb\u2083Sn phase\n3. Evidence that as-deposited or partially-reacted Nb-Sn has ductility advantage\n4. Mechanistic explanation for why this route would improve ductility\n\n**Stop rules:**\n- **STOP if:** Clear evidence that DED cannot form Nb\u2083Sn, or that NaCl substrate is incompatible with the process, or that the A15 phase is always brittle regardless of processing route\n- **STOP if:** Published report of this specific method with ductility data\n- **STOP if:** Strong evidence that the method is thermodynamically or kinetically infeasible\n\n**Test plan:**\n1. Search for: \"directed energy deposition Nb3Sn\" OR \"additive manufacturing niobium tin superconductor\"\n2. Search for: \"NaCl substrate metal deposition\" OR \"dissolvable substrate wire fabrication\"\n3. If inconclusive, search for: \"Nb3Sn ductility\" AND \"processing route\" to understand if any method improves ductility\n\n**Budget:** 3 search queries maximum (cost 3 each). Will use 1-2 queries strategically.\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n## Tool Plan\n\n<ToolPlan>\n**Selected tool:** search (cost 3, up to 3 calls)\n\n**Rationale:**\n1. The claim is about a novel **processing method** (DED with NaCl substrate) and **mechanical properties** (ductility)\n2. CALPHAD is OUT OF SCOPE: can verify Nb\u2083Sn thermodynamic stability (already known) but cannot address process feasibility or ductility\n3. CHGNet is OUT OF SCOPE: not applicable to metallurgical processing or mechanical properties\n4. Search is the ONLY tool that can find evidence of:\n   - DED applied to Nb-Sn systems\n   - NaCl substrate approaches\n   - Ductility improvements in Nb\u2083Sn\n   - Published demonstrations of this specific method\n\n**Query strategy:**\n- **Query 1 (primary):** Target the specific method - DED of Nb-Sn with focus on novel processing routes and ductility\n- **Query 2 (if needed):** Target NaCl substrate approach if Query 1 doesn't find it\n- **Query 3 (if needed):** Target ductility mechanisms in Nb\u2083Sn if first two queries are inconclusive\n\n**Expected outcome:** \n- Best case: Find published work on this specific DED+NaCl method\n- Good case: Find evidence that DED can process Nb-Sn and that substrate approaches exist\n- Acceptable case: Find evidence on ductility limits of Nb\u2083Sn to assess plausibility\n- Worst case: No evidence found \u2192 label as UNVERIFIED/NOVEL (not refuted, but no supporting evidence)\n\n**Stop rule:** After Query 1, assess if claim is decisively supported or refuted. Only proceed to Query 2/3 if inconclusive.\n</ToolPlan>\n\n## Execution\n\nI will now execute Query 1 to search for evidence of DED applied to Nb-Sn systems, with focus on novel processing and ductility improvements.",

Claim (Verbatim)\n\"A new inexpensive route for depositing Nb3Sn wires using directed energy deposition was developed, enabling the fabrication of more ductile wires in an already-coiled geometry.

Scope Lock\n- **System:** Nb\u2083Sn superconducting wires\n- **Manipulation:** Directed energy deposition (DED) of Nb and Sn powders onto NaCl substrate; subsequent dissolution of NaCl\n- **Measurement context:** Ductility (mechanical property), fabrication feasibility, geometric capability (coiled geometry)\n- **Constraints:** Process must produce Nb\u2083Sn phase; must demonstrate ductility improvement over conventional routes (baseline \u03b5_f ~ 0.2-0.5%); must enable coiled geometry fabrication\n\n### 3. Evaluation Type\n**Existential claim:** \"was developed\" implies the method exists and has been demonstrated. Requires evidence of at least one successful implementation.\n\n### 4. Target FoM & Units\n- **Primary FoM:** Ductility (strain-to-failure \u03b5_f in %, or qualitative \"more ductile\")\n- **Secondary FoM:** Process feasibility (can DED produce Nb\u2083Sn on NaCl substrate)\n- **Tertiary FoM:** Geometric capability (coiled geometry without post-processing)\n- **No surrogate used:** Direct search for evidence of the claimed method\n\n### 5. Plan\n**Tool selection:** Search only (cost 3 per query, 3 queries used)\n**Rationale:** CALPHAD and CHGNet are OUT OF SCOPE - this is a processing method and mechanical property claim, not addressable by phase equilibria or atomistic simulations.\n\n**Query strategy:**\n1.

Synthesis\n**What was found:**\n- \u2713 NaCl dissolvable substrate technique is real and published (Nature 2017) for other materials\n- \u2717 NO published evidence of DED/additive manufacturing applied to Nb\u2083Sn systems\n- \u2717 NO evidence of the specific combined method (DED + NaCl + Nb\u2083Sn)\n- \u2717 NO evidence of ductility improvements in Nb\u2083Sn from novel processing routes\n\n**Technical plausibility assessment:**\n- **NaCl substrate:** Demonstrated for other materials; thermally stable enough for moderate-temperature deposition\n- **DED of reactive metals:** Established for Ti, Ni alloys; Nb and Sn are processable individually\n- **Nb\u2083Sn formation:** Requires ~600-900\u00b0C reaction; DED could provide thermal energy\n- **Ductility improvement:** A15 Nb\u2083Sn is inherently brittle due to crystal structure; no mechanism identified for significant ductility enhancement\n\n**Critical gap:** The claim states the method \"was developed\" (past tense, existential), but NO published literature demonstrates this specific method exists.\n\n**Out-of-scope considerations (quarantined):**\n- The method might exist in unpublished/proprietary industrial R&D\n- Very recent publications might not yet be indexed\n- The claim might describe a proposed/hypothetical method rather than demonstrated one\n\n### 8. Score & Rationale\n**Score: 1 - HIGHLY UNLIKELY / NOT SUPPORTED**\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe claim makes an existential assertion (\"was developed\") that requires evidence of the method's existence. After exhausting the search budget (3 queries), I found:\n\n1. **No evidence of DED applied to Nb\u2083Sn:** Query 3 returned zero results for additive manufacturing of Nb\u2083Sn superconductors\n2. **No evidence of the combined method:** Neither DED+Nb\u2083Sn nor NaCl+Nb\u2083Sn combinations were found\n3. **Component validation only:** NaCl substrate technique exists for other materials, but this does not validate the specific Nb\u2083Sn application\n4. **No ductility evidence:** No literature found supporting ductility improvements in Nb\u2083Sn from any novel processing route\n\nThe threshold \u03b8 for an existential claim is: **one published demonstration of the method**. This threshold was NOT met. While individual components (NaCl substrates, DED technology) exist, their combination for Nb\u2083Sn wire fabrication is **not found in accessible published literature**.\n\nThe claim cannot be verified as TRUE based on available evidence. It is scored as HIGHLY UNLIKELY rather than definitively FALSE because:\n- The method might exist in unpublished work\n- Technical components are individually plausible\n- Absence of evidence is not proof of impossibility\n\nHowever, the burden of proof for \"was developed\" requires demonstration, which was not found.\n\n### 9. Sanity/Consistency Checks\n- \u2713 **Units:** Not applicable (qualitative claim, no quantitative data found)\n- \u2713 **Scope fidelity:** Searched specifically for Nb\u2083Sn DED methods\n- \u2713 **Tool selection:** Search was appropriate; CALPHAD/CHGNet correctly identified as out-of-scope\n- \u2713 **Score-narrative agreement:** Score of 1 (HIGHLY UNLIKELY) matches finding of no published evidence\n- \u2713 **Baseline:** Conventional Nb\u2083Sn ductility (\u03b5_f ~ 0.2-0.5%) established as comparison point\n- \u2713 **Query strategy:** Systematic progression from specific method \u2192 substrate technique \u2192 general AM of Nb\u2083Sn\n\n### 10. What Would Change the Score\n**To increase score to LIKELY (4) or CONFIRMED (5):**\n- Published paper demonstrating DED of Nb\u2083Sn on NaCl substrate\n- Patent or technical report describing the specific method with experimental validation\n- Mechanical testing data showing ductility improvement over conventional Nb\u2083Sn wires\n- Microstructural evidence of Nb\u2083Sn formation via this route\n\n**To decrease score to REFUTED (0):**\n- Fundamental thermodynamic incompatibility (e.g., NaCl decomposition at required DED temperatures)\n- Published attempts showing the method fails to produce Nb\u2083Sn\n- Proof that A15 phase ductility cannot be improved regardless of processing\n\n**Most decisive next measurement:**\nA published demonstration of the method with:\n1. Confirmation of Nb\u2083Sn phase formation (XRD, EBSD)\n2. Mechanical testing showing ductility (tensile test, bend test)\n3. Process parameters and reproducibility data",
  "answer": "**VERIFICATION VERDICT: HIGHLY UNLIKELY / NOT SUPPORTED (Score: 1/5)**\n\nThe claim that \"a new inexpensive route for depositing Nb3Sn wires using directed energy deposition was developed\" cannot be verified through available published literature. \n\n**Key findings:**\n1. **No published evidence** of directed energy deposition (DED) or additive manufacturing applied to Nb\u2083Sn superconductors (Query 3: zero results)\n2. **NaCl dissolvable substrate technique exists** for other materials (Nature 2017), validating one component of the claimed method\n3. **No evidence** of the specific combined method (DED + NaCl + Nb\u2083Sn) in accessible literature\n4. **No evidence** of ductility improvements in Nb\u2083Sn from any novel processing route\n\n**Technical assessment:**\n- Individual components (NaCl substrates, DED technology) are established separately\n- The combination for Nb\u2083Sn wire fabrication is **not found in published literature**\n- The claim uses past tense (\"was developed\"), implying the method exists, but this cannot be confirmed\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim is scored as **HIGHLY UNLIKELY** because the existential assertion (\"was developed\") requires evidence of the method's existence, which was not found after exhaustive search. While the method is not definitively impossible (individual components are plausible), the absence of any published demonstration means the claim cannot be verified as true. The method may exist in unpublished/proprietary work, but this cannot be confirmed with available tools and literature."
