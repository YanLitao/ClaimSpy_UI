  "reasoning": "- \u20132 (Infeasible) because A15\u2011La\u2084H\u2082\u2083 is only stabilized and superconducting at ultra\u2011high pressures (~95\u2013120 GPa). At 1 GPa the phase is thermodynamically inaccessible (La\u2013H system favors LaH\u2082/LaH\u2083), so the claim fails at the level of phase existence; additionally, the stated Tc = 105 K exceeds reported values (~81 K at 118 GPa).\n- Minima that must hold:\n  1) A15\u2011La\u2084H\u2082\u2083 is stable at 1 GPa. 2) The sample at 1 GPa is actually A15\u2011La\u2084H\u2082\u2083. 3) It is superconducting with Tc = 105 K at 1 GPa.\n- Evidence mapping:\n  - Contradictory (phase stability/conditions): Multiple reports place A15\u2011La\u2084H\u2082\u2083 stability and superconductivity near 95\u2013118 GPa; no evidence at ~1 GPa.\n  - Direct Tc at matching phase but mismatched pressure: ~81 K at 118 GPa (not 105 K).\n  - Mechanistic plausibility: Hydrogen\u2011rich stoichiometry requires high pressure to stabilize; incompatible with 1 GPa.\n- Why not \u20131: The obstacle is fundamental (phase cannot exist at 1 GPa), not a parametric overreach.\n- Why not 0: Evidence is decisive and condition\u2011matched against the claim.\n- Why not +1/+2: The claim is false under the stated pressure; Tc value also disagrees with best reports.\n- Assumptions/limits: Standard interpretation of hydrostatic pressure; no alternative low\u2011pressure polymorph of La\u2084H\u2082\u2083; literature consensus on La\u2013H phase fields.",
