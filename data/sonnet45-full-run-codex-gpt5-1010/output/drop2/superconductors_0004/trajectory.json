Claim states Tc = 105 K.\n- **Quantifier**: Existential (\"exhibits\") - the claim asserts that this phenomenon occurs/exists at the stated conditions\n- **Threshold \u03b8**: For superconductivity claims, Tc must be demonstrably above the background/noise floor. Given the claim specifies 105 K, I will use \u03b8 = \u00b110 K (approximately 10% tolerance) as significant deviation, which is reasonable for superconductivity measurements and computational predictions.\n</ClaimCard>\n\n<VerbMapping>\n\"Exhibits superconductivity\" \u2192 The material shows a superconducting transition (resistivity drops to zero, Meissner effect) at or near the stated Tc. This is an existential claim requiring demonstration of non-zero superconducting behavior at the specified conditions. We need evidence that Tc \u2248 105 K (within uncertainty bounds).\n</VerbMapping>\n\n<MetricIntegrity>\nThe FoM is **critical temperature (Tc)** in Kelvin. This is a well-defined thermodynamic property. Neither CALPHAD nor CHGNet directly compute Tc - CALPHAD handles phase equilibria and thermodynamic stability, while CHGNet computes structural energies and barriers. **Neither tool can directly verify superconductivity or Tc.** This is a representation gate issue. The only viable approach is **search_tool** to find:\n1. Theoretical predictions of Tc for La\u2084H\u2082\u2083 at 1 GPa\n2. Experimental measurements if available\n3. Domain context for high-pressure hydride superconductors\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\n**Critical assessment**: \n- **CALPHAD**: Does NOT represent superconductivity or electronic properties. Can only verify phase stability of La\u2084H\u2082\u2083 at 1 GPa, which is a prerequisite but not the claim itself.\n- **CHGNet**: Does NOT compute superconducting properties or Tc. Can only assess structural stability.\n- **search_tool**: CAN find literature on superconducting properties, Tc predictions/measurements for this system.\n\n**Conclusion**: The computational tools available cannot directly verify the superconductivity claim. This falls into **Not Represented** territory for computational tools. The only path forward is search_tool to find domain-specific literature on La-H superconductors at high pressure.\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n- **Units**: Tc in Kelvin (K), Pressure in GPa (gigapascals)\n- **Baseline**: High-pressure hydride superconductors are an active research area. LaH\u2081\u2080 (different stoichiometry) has been reported with Tc ~ 250 K at ~170 GPa. At lower pressures (1 GPa), Tc values are expected to be much lower. A Tc of 105 K at 1 GPa would be remarkable but needs verification against literature.\n- **Conversion check**: 1 GPa = 10\u2079 Pa = 10 kbar. No conversion needed for Tc (already in K).\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\nSince computational tools cannot verify Tc:\n1. **Search query 1**: Target La\u2084H\u2082\u2083 specifically - look for theoretical predictions or experimental reports of its superconducting properties, crystal structure (A15 confirmation), and Tc at various pressures including 1 GPa.\n2. **Search query 2** (if needed): Broader context on lanthanum hydride superconductors at low-to-moderate pressures to establish domain ranges and assess plausibility.\n3. **Stop rule**: If search finds matched-condition data (La\u2084H\u2082\u2083, A15 structure, 1 GPa, Tc measurement/prediction), evaluate against \u03b8 = \u00b110 K and stop. If no direct data exists, assess plausibility from related systems and report as **Not Represented** or **Inconclusive**.\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n<ToolPlan>\nGiven that neither CALPHAD nor CHGNet can compute superconducting Tc, the verification must rely entirely on **search_tool**:\n\n**Plan**:\n1. **Search query 1** (cost 3): Search for \"La4H23 A15 superconductivity critical temperature 1 GPa\" to find direct evidence of this specific compound's superconducting properties.\n2. **Conditional search query 2** (cost 3): If query 1 is inconclusive, search for \"lanthanum hydride superconductivity low pressure\" to establish domain context and assess whether 105 K at 1 GPa is within known ranges for La-H systems.\n3. **Stop after sufficient evidence**: If either query provides matched-condition data or clear domain limits, stop and synthesize.\n\n**Rationale**: This is fundamentally an electronic/quantum property that requires either experimental measurement or sophisticated electronic structure calculations (e.g., DFT + electron-phonon coupling). The available tools cannot perform such calculations. Search is the only viable path.\n</ToolPlan>\n\nNow I will execute the first search query to look for specific information about La\u2084H\u2082\u2083 superconductivity.",

Even at the correct pressure, the claimed Tc = 105 K exceeds the reported Tc \u2248 81 K by 24 K, which is outside the \u00b110 K threshold.

What Would Change the Score\n- **Experimental measurement** of La\u2084H\u2082\u2083 at 1 GPa showing phase stability and Tc \u2248 105 K\n- **Theoretical prediction** using DFT + electron-phonon coupling showing Tc > 95 K at 1 GPa\n- **Evidence** that a different La\u2084H\u2082\u2083 polymorph exists at low pressure\n\nCurrently, all evidence indicates the claim confuses pressure regimes by approximately two orders of magnitude."
