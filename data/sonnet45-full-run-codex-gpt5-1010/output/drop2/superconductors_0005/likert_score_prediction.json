  "reasoning": "- Call: \u20131 (Partially Infeasible) because the specific Tc\u2013pressure pair (105 K at 60 GPa) conflicts with reported behavior; the A15 La\u2084H\u2082\u2083 phase is not established at 60 GPa and measured Tc at higher pressure is ~90 K, not 105 K.\n- Minima that must hold:\n  1) A15-type La\u2084H\u2082\u2083 is stable at 60 GPa.\n  2) It is superconducting at that pressure.\n  3) Tc \u2248 105 K under those conditions.\n- Evidence mapping:\n  - Direct/authoritative: Reports (e.g., arXiv:2308.02977) indicate A15 La\u2084H\u2082\u2083 is stable around 96\u2013150 GPa and shows superconductivity with Tc \u2248 90 K near 95 GPa. This contradicts stability at 60 GPa and the stated Tc.\n  - No aligned evidence supports A15 stability or Tc = 105 K at 60 GPa.\n- Why \u20131 (not \u20132): The compound and phenomenon (A15 La\u2084H\u2082\u2083 superconductivity) are real at high pressures; the claim\u2019s quantitative conditions are wrong. Narrowing to ~95\u2013100 GPa with Tc ~90 K would be feasible.\n- Why not 0/+1/+2: Not 0 because there is concrete, condition-matched evidence against the stated pressure and Tc; not +1/+2 because the key conditions (pressure window and Tc value) are mismatched with literature.\n- Assumptions/limits: Accepts reported stability window and Tc as reliable; no evidence for metastable persistence of A15 La\u2084H\u2082\u2083 down to 60 GPa.",
