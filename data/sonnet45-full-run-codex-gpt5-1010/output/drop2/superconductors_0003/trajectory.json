This is a well-defined thermodynamic property. Direct measurement requires resistivity vs. temperature or magnetic susceptibility measurements. Computational proxies include:\n- Electron-phonon coupling constant \u03bb and phonon frequencies \u2192 Tc via McMillan-Allen-Dynes equation\n- Electronic density of states at Fermi level N(EF)\n- Phonon spectrum calculations\n\nIf using computational tools, I must explicitly map the proxy to Tc and acknowledge this is a **surrogate** approach with model-dependent uncertainty.\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\n**Available tools assessment**:\n1. **search_tool**: Can find literature on La-H system superconductivity, A15 structures, high-pressure hydrides\n2. **calphad**: Thermodynamic equilibrium tool - NOT suitable for superconductivity (electronic/phonon property). Can verify phase stability but cannot compute Tc.\n3. **chgnet_mlip**: Machine-learned interatomic potential - NOT suitable for superconductivity (requires electron-phonon coupling, which MLIPs don't capture). Cannot compute Tc.\n\n**Critical finding**: Neither computational tool can directly represent or compute superconducting Tc. CALPHAD handles thermodynamics/phase equilibria; CHGNet handles structure/energetics but not electronic properties needed for superconductivity.\n\nThis is a **representation gap** - the phenomenon (superconductivity, Tc) is **Not Represented** in the available computational tools.\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n- Tc is in Kelvin (K) - no conversion needed\n- Pressure is in GPa (gigapascals) - standard unit for high-pressure studies\n- Baseline: Known high-Tc hydride superconductors include H\u2083S (~203 K at 155 GPa), LaH\u2081\u2080 (~250 K at 170 GPa).

If literature shows different Tc or structure, claim is **Refuted**. If no data exists, claim is **Inconclusive/Not Represented**.\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n<ToolPlan>\n**Plan**: Use search_tool strategically to gather evidence about La\u2084H\u2082\u2083 superconductivity.\n\n**Query 1** (if needed): Search for technical data on \"La4H23 superconductivity critical temperature A15 structure high pressure\"\n- Purpose: Find matched-condition primary data on the exact system\n- Expected: Literature reports, experimental or computational studies of La\u2084H\u2082\u2083\n\n**Query 2** (if needed, only if Query 1 is inconclusive): Search for \"lanthanum hydride superconductivity 118 GPa phase diagram\"\n- Purpose: Broader context on La-H system at this pressure range\n- Expected: Phase stability data, Tc vs. pressure trends\n\n**Query 3** (reserve, only if critical gap remains): Search for \"A15 structure hydride superconductors critical temperature\"\n- Purpose: Establish whether A15-type hydrides are known superconductors and typical Tc ranges\n- Expected: General context on A15 hydride superconductivity\n\n**Rationale**: \n- Cannot use CALPHAD (doesn't compute Tc) or CHGNet (doesn't capture electron-phonon coupling)\n- Must rely on literature search for this electronic property\n- Will use minimal queries (likely 1-2) to find matched-condition data\n- This is a case where the claim's FoM is **Not Represented** in computational tools, making search the only viable approach\n</ToolPlan>\n\n## Decision\n\nI will start with a targeted search query to find literature on La\u2084H\u2082\u2083 superconductivity.

A credible source (EMFL report) documents the synthesis of cubic A15-type La\u2084H\u2082\u2083 and reports exactly the claimed critical temperature (105 K) at exactly the claimed pressure (118 GPa).
