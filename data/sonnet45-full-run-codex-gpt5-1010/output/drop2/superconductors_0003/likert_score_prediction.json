  "reasoning": "+2 (Feasible) because there is direct, condition-matched experimental evidence reporting Tc = 105 K at 118 GPa for A15-type La4H23, with corroborating data at nearby pressure showing consistent pressure dependence.\n\n- Claim minima:\n  1) A15-type La4H23 exists near 118 GPa.\n  2) The phase is correctly identified as A15 (Pm-3n).\n  3) The material is superconducting with Tc = 105 K at 118 GPa (measured under pressure).\n\n- Evidence mapping:\n  - Direct match: EMFL report \u2013 La4H23 (A15), 118 GPa, Tc = 105 K (satisfies all minima under matching conditions).\n  - Corroboration: arXiv:2308.02977 \u2013 same phase/composition, 95 GPa with Tc = 90 K, consistent with increasing Tc vs pressure trend.\n\n- Why not other scores:\n  - Not \u20132/\u20131: No fundamental or quantitative contradiction; conditions and structure are compatible with high-pressure hydride superconductivity.\n  - Not 0/+1: Evidence is direct and exactly matched to the stated conditions, not merely proxy or partial.\n\n- Assumptions/limitations:\n  - Relies on accuracy and robustness of the EMFL report and structural assignment; broader peer-reviewed confirmation would further solidify confidence.",
