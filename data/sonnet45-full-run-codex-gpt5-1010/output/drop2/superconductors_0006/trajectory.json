All three must be verified for the full claim. The exact FoM for superconductivity is Tc in Kelvin. No proxy is needed if we can directly assess phase stability and electronic structure relevant to superconductivity.\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\n**CALPHAD:** Can assess thermodynamic phase stability for V-Nb-Mo-Ir-Pt system IF a suitable database exists. A15 phases are intermetallic compounds; representation depends on database coverage of 5-component noble/refractory metal systems. This is uncertain\u2014many TDBs focus on structural alloys, not superconducting intermetallics.\n\n**CHGNet MLIP:** Trained on Materials Project data. Can assess structural stability and relative energies. However:\n- A15 is a specific ordered structure; CHGNet may not have extensive training on A15 superconductors\n- Tc prediction requires electronic structure (density of states at Fermi level, electron-phonon coupling) which MLIPs do not directly provide\n- Can assess: formation energy, structural stability\n- Cannot assess: Tc directly\n\n**Search:** Can find literature on:\n- A15 phase superconductors (known ranges for Tc)\n- V-Nb-Mo based A15 alloys\n- High-entropy A15 superconductors\n- Specific reports of this composition\n\n**Representation verdict:** \n- CALPHAD: uncertain representation (5-component noble/refractory system)\n- CHGNet: can assess stability but NOT Tc\n- Search: best tool for finding matched-condition data on A15 superconductors and this specific system\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n**Units:** Tc in Kelvin (K) \u2014 no conversion needed.\n**Baseline/Context:** \n- A15 superconductors are well-known: Nb\u2083Sn (Tc ~18 K), Nb\u2083Ge (Tc ~23 K), V\u2083Si (Tc ~17 K)\n- Pure V: Tc ~5.4 K (bcc)\n- Pure Nb: Tc ~9.2 K (bcc)\n- Pure Mo: non-superconducting down to ~0.9 K\n- Ir and Pt: weak superconductors (Tc < 0.2 K)\n- The claimed Tc = 5.18 K is LOWER than typical A15 phases but in a reasonable range for diluted or off-stoichiometric A15 structures\n- A15 phase typically forms at A\u2083B stoichiometry; the claimed composition is complex and may be off-stoichiometry\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n**Test strategy:**\n1. **Literature search** (primary): Look for reports of V-Nb-Mo-Ir-Pt A15 HEAs, Tc measurements, synthesis reports\n   - Query 1: A15 phase high-entropy alloys with V, Nb, Mo, Ir, Pt\n   - Query 2 (if needed): Superconducting critical temperature A15 refractory alloys\n   \n2. **Computational verification** (if literature insufficient):\n   - CHGNet: assess whether the composition is thermodynamically stable in A15 structure vs competing phases\n   - CALPHAD: check phase stability IF database represents the system\n   \n**Stop rules:**\n- If literature confirms synthesis + A15 + Tc ~5.18 K for this composition \u2192 STOP (Supported)\n- If literature shows this composition is unstable or forms different phases \u2192 STOP (Refuted)\n- If no literature exists but computational tools show A15 is stable \u2192 Conditional/Plausible\n- If computational tools show A15 is unstable \u2192 Refuted\n\n**Decision:** Start with search_tool to look for direct evidence of this claim or closely related systems.\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n<ToolPlan>\n**Primary lane:** Literature search (cost 3, up to 3 queries)\n- This is an existential claim about a specific synthesized material\n- If this has been made, it should appear in literature\n- Search can provide matched-condition data on A15 HEAs and Tc measurements\n\n**Secondary lane (if needed):** CHGNet for structural stability assessment\n- Only if literature is insufficient or contradictory\n- Cannot directly verify Tc, but can assess if A15 is plausible structure\n\n**CALPHAD:** Likely NOT useful\n- 5-component system with noble metals (Ir, Pt) unlikely to be well-represented\n- A15 is an ordered intermetallic; many TDBs don't include these phases\n\n**Execution plan:**\n1. Search for this specific composition or closely related V-Nb-Mo-Ir-Pt A15 HEAs\n2. If found with matching properties \u2192 STOP (Supported)\n3. If not found, search for A15 HEA superconductors more broadly to assess plausibility\n4. If still inconclusive, consider CHGNet for stability assessment\n5. Synthesize evidence and score\n\n**Expected outcome:** Literature search should be decisive for this existential synthesis claim.\n</ToolPlan>\n\nNow I'll execute the plan, starting with a targeted literature search.",

Superconductivity with Tc up to 5.18 K\n\nThis is an **existential claim** (\"have been synthesized, exhibiting\"), requiring demonstration that at least one instance exists with these properties.\n\n**Tool Selection Rationale:**\nGiven this is a claim about a specific synthesized material, literature search was identified as the optimal primary tool. The search could provide matched-condition experimental data, while computational tools (CHGNet, CALPHAD) would be secondary since they cannot directly predict Tc and may lack representation for this 5-component noble/refractory metal system.\n\n**Evidence Obtained:**\nTwo targeted literature searches identified the primary research paper (Frontiers in Physics, 2021) reporting this exact system.
