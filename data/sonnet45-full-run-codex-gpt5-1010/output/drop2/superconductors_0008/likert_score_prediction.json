  "reasoning": "- \u20132 (Infeasible) because La4H23 is only reported to form under very high hydrogen chemical potential at ~50\u2013180 GPa (diamond anvil cell), whereas cosputtering occurs at ultra\u2011low pressures; the route cannot access the required thermodynamics to stabilize such a hydrogen\u2011rich phase, so a superconducting La4H23 film via cosputtering is not feasible as stated.\n- Claim minima:\n  1) La4H23 composition/phase must be attainable by cosputtering under vacuum conditions.\n  2) The resulting thin film must retain La4H23 at ambient.\n  3) The film must exhibit superconductivity.\n- Evidence:\n  - Direct/authoritative: La4H23 existence/stability reported only at ~50\u2013180 GPa (DAC high\u2011pressure synthesis).\n  - Process conditions: Cosputtering at ~10^-9\u201310^-6 GPa yields La\u2013H films limited to lower H content (\u2248LaH2\u2013LaH3); no reports of superhydrides (LaH6\u2013LaH10, La4H23) by thin\u2011film sputtering.\n  - Contradiction: >10 orders of magnitude pressure mismatch\u2014fatal for stabilizing La4H23.\n- Why not other scores:\n  - Not \u20131: The mismatch is fundamental (thermodynamic/pressure requirement), not a mere range tuning.\n  - Not 0: Conditions are specified and conflict with established stability windows.\n  - Not +1/+2: No condition\u2011matched evidence that sputtering can make or trap La4H23; superconductivity is moot without the phase.\n- Assumptions/limits: Assumes no undisclosed post\u2011deposition ultrahigh\u2011pressure treatment or exotic plasma/implantation achieving GPa\u2011equivalent hydrogen chemical potential.",
