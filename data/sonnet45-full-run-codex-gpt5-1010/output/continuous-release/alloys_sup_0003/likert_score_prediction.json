  "reasoning": "- \u20132 (Infeasible) because the claim requires oxidation at 800\u00b0C to be lower than at 500\u00b0C in TA15, which contradicts well\u2011established Arrhenius kinetics and the known oxidation behavior of Ti alloys; no mechanism is offered that could plausibly invert the temperature dependence, and the asserted mechanical improvement after 800\u00b0C exposure conflicts with oxygen pickup/alpha\u2011case embrittlement.\n- Minima that must hold:\n  1) TA15 shows greater (maximal) oxidation at 500\u00b0C than at 800\u00b0C under comparable exposure. 2) Microstructure is stable at 500\u00b0C. 3) Oxidation at 800\u00b0C is minimal. 4) Reduced oxidation at 800\u00b0C significantly improves mechanical performance.\n- Evidence mapping:\n  \u2022 Authoritative/thermo-kinetic: Oxidation of Ti alloys increases with temperature (positive activation energy; typical Ea ~150\u2013250 kJ/mol). A simple Arrhenius ratio indicates k(800\u00b0C) >> k(500\u00b0C).  \n  \u2022 Mechanistic plausibility: While Al additions can promote more protective scales, they do not reverse the fundamental temperature dependence; TA15\u2019s composition is not known to form a fully protective continuous alumina that would yield lower net oxidation at 800\u00b0C than 500\u00b0C.  \n  \u2022 Contradictions: Ti alloys generally oxidize much more severely at ~800\u00b0C, forming thick TiO2/oxygen\u2011enriched alpha\u2011case; high\u2011T exposure typically degrades surface\u2011affected mechanical properties rather than \u201csignificantly improving\u201d them.  \n  \u2022 Direct evidence: None provided supporting the inversion; searches did not find corroborating TA15 data.\n- Why not other scores:\n  \u2022 +2/+1: No direct, condition\u2011matched evidence supports the inversion; fundamentals argue against it.  \n  \u2022 0: Not merely underspecified\u2014physics and broad literature trends point strongly against the claim as stated.  \n  \u2022 \u20131: Not just an optimistic range issue; it requires a reversal of temperature dependence, a fundamental contradiction.\n- Assumptions/limits: Oxidizing atmosphere and comparable exposure times are implied; acknowledge rare, tightly bounded transients could complicate short\u2011time data, but the claim is general (\u201cmaximal/minimal\u201d), so those do not rescue it.",
