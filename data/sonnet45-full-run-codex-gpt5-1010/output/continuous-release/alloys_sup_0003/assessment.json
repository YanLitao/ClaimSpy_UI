For thermally-activated oxidation with typical activation energies (150-250 kJ/mol for Ti-Al alloys), oxidation rates increase exponentially with temperature. The calculated rate ratio k\u2088\u2080\u2080/k\u2085\u2080\u2080 \u2248 6000\u00d7 demonstrates that oxidation at 800\u00b0C should vastly exceed that at 500\u00b0C, not be 'minimal' as claimed.",
