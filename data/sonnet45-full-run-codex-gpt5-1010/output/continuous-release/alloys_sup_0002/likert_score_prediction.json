  "reasoning": "0 (Cannot determine) because the claim hinges on oxidation kinetics, oxide-scale adherence/spallation, and microstructure/property evolution\u2014phenomena that require matched-condition experiments or specialized oxidation models not available here; key conditions (atmosphere, exposure time, surface state, cycling) are unspecified, and while the stated temperature inversion contradicts typical Arrhenius trends for Ti alloys, this alone is insufficient to adjudicate feasibility as stated.\n\n- Claim decomposition (minima that must hold):\n  1) TA15 shows minimal oxidation and stable microstructure at 800 \u00b0C under the same exposure conditions as at 500 \u00b0C.\n  2) At 500 \u00b0C, oxidation is severe, with repeated spallation, TiO2/Al2O3 dominance, grain growth, reduced \u03b2 fraction, and degraded mechanical performance\u2014all under comparable conditions.\n  3) The observed inversion (500 \u00b0C worse than 800 \u00b0C) must persist for standard/implicit environments (e.g., air) and practical timescales.\n\n- Evidence mapping:\n  \u2022 Direct (matching conditions): None (search failed; no experimental data retrieved).  \n  \u2022 Indirect/proxy: General Ti-alloy oxidation increases with temperature; alumina-scale continuity on ~6\u20137 wt% Al Ti alloys is limited, especially at 500 \u00b0C\u2014this hints against the claim but is not decisive without conditions.  \n  \u2022 Contradictions: None definitive under the claim\u2019s (unspecified) conditions.\n\n- Why not other Likerts:\n  \u2022 \u20132: Not a fundamental impossibility; specific environments (e.g., chlorides, water vapor, cyclic thermal stresses) could, in principle, invert behavior.  \n  \u2022 \u20131: Although the trend is likely wrong in air, the claim is underspecified and we lack matched-condition data to say it\u2019s probably wrong as stated.  \n  \u2022 +1/+2: No direct supporting evidence; tools are misaligned with the phenomena.\n\n- Assumptions/limitations: Atmosphere, time, surface finish, prior oxide, thermal cycling, and load are unspecified; these can strongly alter oxidation/spallation and microstructure evolution in TA15.",
