This violates typical Arrhenius behavior where oxidation rates increase with temperature. The threshold for significance is the **direction of the effect** itself - we need evidence that 500\u00b0C oxidation is demonstrably more severe than 800\u00b0C oxidation.\n</ClaimCard>\n\n<VerbMapping>\n- \"exhibits minimal oxidation\" \u2192 oxidation layer thickness/mass gain significantly less than at 500\u00b0C\n- \"severe oxidation\" \u2192 substantial oxide layer formation with repeated peeling/spalling\n- \"stable microstructural evolution\" \u2192 grain size and phase fractions remain relatively unchanged\n- \"reducing \u03b2-phase proportion\" \u2192 measurable decrease in \u03b2-phase volume fraction\n- \"significantly compromising\" \u2192 measurable degradation in mechanical properties (strength, ductility, etc.)\n</VerbMapping>\n\n<MetricIntegrity>\nThe claim involves multiple FoMs:\n1. **Oxidation severity** - can be quantified by oxide thickness, mass gain, or spalling behavior\n2. **Oxide composition** - phase identification (TiO\u2082, Al\u2082O\u2083)\n3. **Microstructural changes** - grain size, \u03b2-phase fraction\n4. **Mechanical performance** - strength, hardness, ductility\n\nThe **core anomaly** is the temperature inversion in oxidation behavior. This is the primary metric to verify. The microstructural and mechanical changes are presented as consequences of the oxidation behavior.\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\nAvailable tools:\n- **search_tool**: Can find literature on TA15 oxidation behavior at different temperatures\n- **calphad**: Can predict phase equilibria and stability, but NOT oxidation kinetics or mechanical properties directly\n- **chgnet_mlip**: Can compute formation energies and barriers, but oxidation is a complex surface phenomenon involving oxygen diffusion, scale formation, and spalling - not well-suited for this MLIP\n\n**Assessment:** \n- CALPHAD cannot directly address oxidation kinetics or the temperature inversion claim\n- CHGNet MLIP is not appropriate for complex oxidation phenomena involving gas-solid reactions, scale formation, and spalling\n- **search_tool is the primary appropriate tool** to find experimental data on TA15 oxidation at these specific temperatures\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n- Temperatures: 500\u00b0C = 773 K; 800\u00b0C = 1073 K\n- Oxidation typically measured in: oxide thickness (\u03bcm), mass gain (mg/cm\u00b2), or parabolic rate constants (kg\u00b2/m\u2074/s)\n- \u03b2-phase fraction: volume % or area %\n- Mechanical properties: MPa (strength), % (elongation), HV (hardness)\n\n**Baseline expectation:** Standard Arrhenius behavior predicts oxidation rate increases with temperature. The claim asserts the opposite, which requires strong experimental evidence.\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n**Stop rule:** This is a **universal comparative claim** with a counterintuitive assertion. \n- If literature shows standard Arrhenius behavior (800\u00b0C > 500\u00b0C oxidation), the claim is **refuted** \u2192 STOP\n- If literature confirms the inversion (500\u00b0C > 800\u00b0C oxidation) with mechanistic explanation, the claim is **supported** \u2192 STOP\n- The claim is **highly specific** to TA15 at these exact temperatures, so we need **on-system, matched-condition** data\n\n**Decisive test:** Search for experimental studies on TA15 (or very similar Ti-6Al-2Zr-1Mo-1V) oxidation behavior comparing these temperature regimes.\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n<ToolPlan>\n**Plan:**\n1. **search_tool (Query 1)**: Search for TA15 alloy oxidation behavior at 500\u00b0C and 800\u00b0C, focusing on comparative studies or data at both temperatures. This should reveal whether the claimed temperature inversion is documented.\n\n2. **Conditional Query 2**: If Query 1 is inconclusive, search for titanium alloy oxidation mechanisms that might explain temperature-dependent behavior (e.g., protective oxide formation at higher temperatures vs. non-protective at lower temperatures).\n\n3. **Conditional Query 3**: Only if needed, search for TA15 microstructural evolution and mechanical property changes due to oxidation.\n\n**Rationale:** \n- The claim's core assertion (temperature inversion in oxidation) is **highly unusual** and requires experimental validation\n- Neither CALPHAD nor CHGNet can address oxidation kinetics or the complex surface phenomena involved\n- Search is the only appropriate tool to find matched-condition experimental data\n- The claim is specific enough that 1-2 well-targeted searches should be decisive\n</ToolPlan>\n\n## Decision\n\nI will start with a targeted search for TA15 oxidation behavior at these specific temperatures. The counterintuitive nature of the claim (lower temperature causing more severe oxidation) means this should be well-documented if true, or contradicted by standard oxidation literature if false.",
