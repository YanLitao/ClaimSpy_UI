  "reasoning": "+1 (Partially Feasible) because the temperature\u2011dependent oxidation contrast (minimal at ~500\u00b0C vs severe, spalling TiO2/Al2O3 scales at ~800\u00b0C) and consequent mechanical degradation are well established for near\u2011\u03b1 Ti alloys and plausibly transferable to TA15, but the claim lacks direct, condition\u2011matched data on TA15 itself and the \u201c\u03b2\u2011phase reduction\u201d is inferred (likely confined to the oxygen\u2011enriched surface zone) rather than directly evidenced.\n\nClaim decomposition (minima that must hold):\n- Entity/conditions: TA15 (Ti\u20116.5Al\u20112Zr\u20111Mo\u20111V) in oxidizing atmosphere; timescale not specified.\n- 500\u00b0C: minimal oxidation and stable microstructure.\n- 800\u00b0C: severe oxidation with TiO2 and Al2O3; peeling/spalling; grain growth.\n- \u03b2\u2011phase fraction reduced (at least in the affected region) at 800\u00b0C due to oxidation.\n- Mechanical performance significantly compromised after 800\u00b0C exposure.\n\nEvidence mapping:\n- Direct/near\u2011direct (analogous alloys, matched T range): \n  - Minimal oxidation at ~500\u00b0C with adherent, fine scales (near\u2011\u03b1 Ti systems).\n  - Severe oxidation at ~800\u00b0C: thick rutile\u2011TiO2\u2013rich scales with Al2O3, cracking/spalling (\u201cbreakaway\u201d behavior).\n  - Grain growth at elevated T; oxygen\u2011affected zone formation; embrittlement and property degradation (hardness up, ductility down).\n- Indirect/proxy:\n  - \u03b2\u2011reduction via oxygen\u2011induced \u03b1\u2011stabilization is mechanistically well supported in Ti alloys; strongest near the surface where oxygen ingress is highest.\n- Potential contradictions:\n  - Equilibrium \u03b2 fraction increases with T toward \u03b2\u2011transus; however, this does not account for oxygen ingress. Under oxidation, local \u03b1\u2011stabilization near the surface can reduce \u03b2 there\u2014so no fatal conflict with the claim when interpreted for the oxidized region.\n\nWhy not other scores:\n- Not \u20131/\u20132: No fundamental contradiction; literature strongly supports the main effects at stated temperatures for this alloy class.\n- Not 0: Evidence is directionally consistent and substantial, not merely ambiguous.\n- Not +2: Missing TA15\u2011specific, condition\u2011matched measurements for all elements (especially explicit \u03b2\u2011fraction reduction and quantified \u201csignificant\u201d mechanical loss), and the claim\u2019s scope (bulk vs oxygen\u2011affected surface, exposure time) is underspecified.\n\nAssumptions/limitations:\n- Air/oxidizing environment and exposures on the order of hours.\n- \u201c\u03b2\u2011phase reduction\u201d refers primarily to the oxygen\u2011enriched near\u2011surface zone, not necessarily the bulk.\n- \u201cMinimal oxidation\u201d at 500\u00b0C denotes thin, adherent scales with limited property impact over typical durations.",
