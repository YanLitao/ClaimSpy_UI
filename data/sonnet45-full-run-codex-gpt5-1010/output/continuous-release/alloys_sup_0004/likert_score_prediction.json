  "reasoning": "-2 (Infeasible) because the high\u2011temperature portion of the claim is fatally inconsistent with established thermodynamics: 1800\u00b0C exceeds the melting point of Ti and TA15 (~1668\u00b0C liquidus range), so solid\u2011state microstructural features (grain growth, \u03b2\u2011phase fraction changes) are not well\u2011defined, and the assertion that the \u03b2\u2011phase proportion is reduced at such temperature contradicts known phase behavior (\u03b2 fraction increases with T and is 100% above the \u03b2\u2011transus in the solid; above the liquidus, \u201c\u03b2 fraction\u201d is undefined). The low\u2011temperature part (200\u00b0C: minimal oxidation, stable microstructure) is plausible, but the claim as a whole fails due to the fatal contradiction at 1800\u00b0C.\n\nClaim decomposition (necessary minima):\n- At 200\u00b0C in air: minimal oxidation and stable microstructure. \n- At 1800\u00b0C in air: (i) solid alloy state, (ii) severe oxidation yielding TiO2/Al2O3 with spalling, (iii) grain growth, (iv) reduced \u03b2\u2011phase fraction, (v) degraded mechanical performance.\n\nEvidence mapping:\n- Direct knowledge: Ti and Ti\u2011alloy liquidus ~1668\u00b0C; TA15 expected similar \u2192 contradicts \u201csolid microstructure\u201d at 1800\u00b0C. \n- Standard phase behavior: \u03b2 fraction increases with T; above \u03b2\u2011transus the alloy is fully \u03b2 (in solid) \u2192 contradicts \u201creduced \u03b2 fraction\u201d at stated T.\n- Oxidation trends: At 200\u00b0C, oxidation is slow and microstructure stable \u2192 supports low\u2011T part. At very high T, severe oxidation/peeling is qualitatively plausible, but at 1800\u00b0C the metal would be molten/combustive, invalidating solid\u2011state microstructural claims.\n\nWhy not other scores:\n- Not \u20131: The issue is fundamental (temperature exceeds liquidus), not a parameter tweak. \n- Not 0: Although tool searches failed, the melting point contradiction alone decides infeasibility as stated. \n- Not +1/+2: High\u2011T microstructural/phase claims are impossible under the stated condition.\n\nAssumptions/limitations:\n- Composition is TA15 (wt%). Air/oxidizing environment implied. Even if 1800\u00b0F (~982\u00b0C) were intended, that would change feasibility; but the claim explicitly states 1800\u00b0C and must be judged as written.",
