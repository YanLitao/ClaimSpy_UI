Using CALPHAD to verify the \u03b2-phase evolution claim, which is computationally accessible\n3. Reasoning from first principles about oxidation at these temperatures\n\nLet me analyze what I know:\n\n**From parametric knowledge:**\n- Ti alloys oxidize readily at elevated temperatures, forming primarily TiO\u2082 (rutile) with Al\u2082O\u2083 as a secondary oxide when Al is present\n- At 200\u00b0C: oxidation is very slow (parabolic kinetics), oxide layers are thin (nm to \u03bcm scale over reasonable times)\n- At high temperatures (>800\u00b0C): oxidation accelerates dramatically, oxide layers can be thick (tens to hundreds of \u03bcm), spalling is common\n- **Critical issue:** 1800\u00b0C is above the melting point of Ti (~1668\u00b0C) and likely above the liquidus of TA15 (~1650-1700\u00b0C). At this temperature, the alloy would be molten or near-molten, which fundamentally changes the behavior.\n\n**\u03b2-phase behavior:**\n- TA15 is a near-\u03b1 alloy with small \u03b2-phase fraction at room temperature\n- \u03b2-transus is around 995-1050\u00b0C for TA15\n- At 200\u00b0C: predominantly \u03b1-phase (\u03b2-phase fraction very low, ~5-10%)\n- At temperatures approaching \u03b2-transus: \u03b2-phase fraction increases\n- Above \u03b2-transus: fully \u03b2-phase (but this transforms to \u03b1 on cooling)\n- At 1800\u00b0C (if solid): would be fully \u03b2, but this is above melting point\n\n**Verification strategy:**\nSince I cannot search, I should use CALPHAD to verify the \u03b2-phase evolution aspect of the claim, which is the most directly testable part with available tools. The oxidation claims align with general Ti alloy behavior, but the 1800\u00b0C temperature is physically problematic.\n\nLet me use CALPHAD to check:\n1. \u03b2-phase fraction at 200\u00b0C\n2. \u03b2-phase fraction at temperatures up to melting\n3. Whether the claim about \"reducing \u03b2-phase proportion\" at 1800\u00b0C makes sense\n\nActually, wait - the claim says \"reducing the \u03b2-phase proportion\" at 1800\u00b0C. This is counterintuitive because:\n- At low T (200\u00b0C): low \u03b2-phase fraction\n- As T increases toward \u03b2-transus: \u03b2-phase fraction increases\n- Above \u03b2-transus: fully \u03b2-phase\n\nThe claim suggests \u03b2-phase DECREASES at 1800\u00b0C, which would only make sense if:\n1. The alloy is molten (phases don't exist in the same way)\n2. There's preferential oxidation/loss of \u03b2-stabilizers\n3. The measurement is after cooling (transformed \u03b2 \u2192 \u03b1)\n\nLet me use CALPHAD to verify the phase behavior and see if I can make sense of this claim.",

The claim that \u03b2-phase proportion *reduces* at 1800\u00b0C contradicts standard phase behavior (\u03b2-fraction increases with temperature) unless interpreted as post-cooling state or compositional change due to oxidation. Oxidation kinetics and microstructural evolution are NOT REPRESENTED in available computational tools, and matched-condition experimental data could not be retrieved due to search tool failure.\n\n**8.
