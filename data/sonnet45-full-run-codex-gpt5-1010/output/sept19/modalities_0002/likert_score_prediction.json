  "reasoning": "+2 (Feasible) because the maximum Tc reported for B2 (CsCl-type) superconductors is relatively low (typically a few kelvin), whereas multiple well-established B1 (rocksalt) superconductors already exhibit substantially higher Tc (e.g., \u03b4\u2011NbN ~16\u201317 K, NbC ~11\u201312 K, ZrN ~10\u201312 K). Therefore, the existence/discovery of a new B1 superconductor whose Tc exceeds the B2-family maximum is entirely consistent with known literature.\n\nClaim decomposition (minima):\n- Define the comparison: max Tc(B2) = M under comparable, ambient-pressure conditions.\n- Existence of at least one B1 superconductor with Tc > M.\n- \u201cNew\u201d discovery does not impose additional physical constraints; it asserts existence consistent with known trends.\n\nEvidence mapping:\n- Direct/known literature: B1 nitrides/carbides (\u03b4\u2011NbN, NbC, ZrN) with Tc \u2273 10\u201317 K.\n- B2 intermetallic superconductors generally show low Tc (order 1\u20135 K in reported CsCl-type systems such as ScIr-, ZrIr-, HfOs-type compounds), with no widely recognized B2 examples approaching the B1 nitrides\u2019 Tc.\n- No contradictions known where B2 maxima exceed the B1 nitrides/carbides.\n\nWhy not other scores:\n- \u20132/\u20131: No fundamental or quantitative contradiction; comparative ordering is supported by numerous exemplars.\n- 0: Not underspecified for feasibility; direction is clear given established Tc ranges.\n- +1 vs +2: Multiple existing B1s already exceed B2 maxima, satisfying all necessary elements; hence +2.\n\nAssumptions/notes:\n- Comparison at ambient pressure and bulk samples (excludes high-pressure superhydrides with different structures).\n- Structure assignments (B1/B2) are standard and widely documented.\n- The \u201cnew\u201d aspect pertains to novelty, not a physical hurdle; feasibility is determined by the comparative Tc landscape.",
