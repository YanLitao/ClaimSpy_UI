Given typical measurement uncertainties in Tc (~0.1-0.5 K), a meaningful difference would be \u22650.5 K above the B2 maximum.\n</ClaimCard>\n\n<VerbMapping>\n- \"has been discovered\" \u2192 existential claim: there exists at least one B1 superconductor\n- \"higher Tc than is observed in the B2 family\" \u2192 Tc(B1_new) > max(Tc_B2_family)\n- This is a comparative claim requiring knowledge of both B1 and B2 superconductor families\n</VerbMapping>\n\n<MetricIntegrity>\nThe FoM is explicitly Tc (critical temperature). This is a directly measurable quantity in superconductivity. No proxy is needed. The claim requires:\n1. Identification of the highest Tc in the B2 family\n2. Verification that a B1 superconductor exists with Tc exceeding this value\n</MetricIntegrity>\n\n<RepresentationGate>\n**Critical issue:** Neither CALPHAD nor CHGNet MLIP are designed to predict superconducting critical temperatures. \n- CALPHAD: thermodynamic phase equilibria tool, does not model electronic properties or superconductivity\n- CHGNet MLIP: structural relaxation and energy calculations, does not capture superconducting phenomena\n\n**Conclusion:** The computational tools available (calphad, chgnet_mlip) do NOT represent superconductivity or Tc. This claim is **OUT OF SCOPE** for the available computational tools.\n\nThe only viable tool is **search_tool** to find literature data on:\n1. Known Tc values for B2 superconductors (to establish the baseline)\n2. Known Tc values for B1 superconductors (to verify the claim)\n</RepresentationGate>\n\n<UnitsAndBaseline>\n- Units: Tc in Kelvin (K)\n- Baseline: Need to establish max(Tc) for B2 family from literature\n- Crystal structures: B1 = NaCl structure (rock salt, fcc), B2 = CsCl structure (ordered bcc)\n</UnitsAndBaseline>\n\n<MinimalDecisiveDesign>\nSince computational tools cannot represent superconductivity:\n1. Search for highest known Tc in B2 superconductors\n2. Search for B1 superconductors and their Tc values\n3. Compare: if any B1 has Tc > max(B2), claim is supported; otherwise refuted\n\n**Stop rule:** This is an existential claim. One well-documented B1 superconductor with Tc > max(B2_Tc) suffices to support. Conversely, if literature shows max(B1_Tc) < max(B2_Tc), claim is refuted.\n</MinimalDecisiveDesign>\n</PreFlight>\n\n<ToolPlan>\nGiven that CALPHAD and CHGNet cannot model superconductivity:\n\n**Plan:**\n1. **search_tool** (query 1): Search for \"B2 structure superconductors highest Tc critical temperature\" to establish the B2 baseline\n2. **search_tool** (query 2): Search for \"B1 structure NaCl rock salt superconductors Tc critical temperature\" to find B1 superconductor data\n3. Compare results and determine if claim is supported\n\n**Rationale:** \n- Only search_tool can access the necessary superconductivity data\n- Two targeted queries should suffice for this comparative claim\n- This is a literature-verifiable claim about known materials properties\n</ToolPlan>\n\nNow I'll execute the first search to establish the B2 baseline.",

Score & Rationale\n**NOT REPRESENTED / OUT OF SCOPE**\n\nThis is not a refutation of the claim; rather, the available tools fundamentally cannot address superconductivity phenomena.

What Would Change the Score\nTo verify this claim, one would need:\n1. **Access to superconductivity databases** containing Tc values for compounds organized by crystal structure (Strukturbericht designation)\n2. **Comprehensive literature review** of B1 and B2 structure superconductors with documented Tc measurements\n3. **Specific material identification:** knowing which B1 compound is claimed to have the high Tc\n4. **Experimental validation:** independent measurements confirming the Tc values\n\n**Minimal decisive evidence:** A table showing max(Tc) for B2 family and at least one B1 compound with Tc exceeding that value, from peer-reviewed sources.\n\n### Red-Flag Assessment\n- \u2717 No metric-term mismatch (Tc correctly identified)\n- \u2717 No inappropriate tool usage (correctly rejected out-of-scope tools)\n- \u2713 **Representation failure acknowledged** (primary issue)\n- \u2713 Search budget exhausted without decisive data\n- \u2713 Proper \"Not Represented\" outcome declared",
  "answer": "**NOT REPRESENTED / OUT OF SCOPE**\n\nThe claim \"A new B1 superconductor has been discovered with a higher Tc than is observed in the B2 family\" cannot be verified with the available tools. \n\n**Reason:** Superconducting critical temperature (Tc) is an electronic property that requires specialized databases or computational methods capable of modeling superconductivity. The available tools\u2014CALPHAD (thermodynamic phase equilibria), CHGNet MLIP (structural/energetic calculations), and limited search capability\u2014fundamentally cannot represent or predict superconducting phenomena. The search tool exhausted its budget without retrieving the necessary quantitative Tc data for B1 (NaCl structure) or B2 (CsCl structure) superconductor families.\n\nThis outcome is not a refutation of the claim; it indicates that verification requires access to superconductivity-specific resources (e.g., SuperCon database, specialized DFT codes for superconductors) that are outside the scope of the current tool set."
