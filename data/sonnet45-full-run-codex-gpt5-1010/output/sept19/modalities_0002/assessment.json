The trajectory attempted verification but encountered fundamental tool limitations: CALPHAD and CHGNet cannot model superconductivity, and three search queries failed to retrieve quantitative Tc data for either structure family.",

Well-established B1 superconductors include \u03b4-NbN (Tc ~16-17 K), NbC (Tc ~11-12 K), and ZrN (Tc ~10-12 K). In contrast, B2 (CsCl-type) intermetallic superconductors typically exhibit much lower Tc values, generally in the 1-5 K range for compounds like ScIr-, ZrIr-, and HfOs-type systems.",

This makes the existence of a 'new' B1 superconductor with Tc higher than B2 maximum entirely feasible and consistent with known structural-property relationships in superconductors.",
