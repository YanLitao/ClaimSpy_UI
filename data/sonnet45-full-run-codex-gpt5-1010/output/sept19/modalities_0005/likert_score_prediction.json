  "reasoning": "- Call: \u20131 (Partially Infeasible) because the claim\u2019s core phenomenon (ScN superconductivity at ambient pressure) is plausible per cited baseline, but the specific numerical assertion \u201cTc = 3 K at 1 atm\u201d is contradicted by established values (\u224815\u201317 K) and no condition-matched evidence supports 3 K; the \u201cdevice\u201d assertion is unsubstantiated as stated.\n\n- Claim decomposition:\n  1) ScN can be superconducting at ambient pressure.\n  2) Under some \u201cright conditions,\u201d ScN has Tc \u2248 3 K at 1 atm.\n  3) A device has been developed \u201cbased around\u201d this superconducting ScN.\n\n- Evidence mapping:\n  - Direct/authoritative: Literature baseline cited indicates rock-salt ScN exhibits Tc \u2248 15\u201317 K at 1 atm (contradicts 3 K).\n  - Searches found no reports of ScN with Tc \u2248 3 K at ambient pressure.\n  - Out-of-scope: Elemental Sc shows \u22483 K under high pressure (not ScN, not 1 atm).\n\n- Decision:\n  - The phenomenon (ScN superconductivity at ambient) is plausible, but the specific Tc = 3 K is likely wrong as stated. That fits \u201cright effect, wrong numeric range\u201d \u2192 \u20131.\n  - The device claim lacks corroborating evidence and depends on the incorrect Tc; at best, it remains unverified.\n\n- Why not other scores:\n  - \u20132: Not fundamentally impossible given baseline reports of superconducting ScN; the issue is the stated Tc value, not feasibility of superconductivity per se.\n  - 0: Not purely uncertain\u2014there is specific contradictory literature for the stated Tc.\n  - +1/+2: No supporting, condition-matched evidence for 3 K (and a strong contradiction exists); device evidence is absent.\n\n- Assumptions/limitations: Accepts the reported literature baseline (Tc \u2248 15\u201317 K for ScN at 1 atm) as established; no direct device characterization provided.",
