  "reasoning": "-1 (Partially Infeasible) because the claim hinges on a BCC HEA achieving >80% tensile elongation and outperforming FCC/mixed-phase HEAs in ductility\u2014both are strongly at odds with established HEA behavior and dislocation mechanics at room temperature. Typical room-temperature elongations: FCC HEAs ~60\u201370% (e.g., Cantor), mixed-phase ~20\u201340%, BCC HEAs ~5\u201320% (often much lower, especially lightweight/refractory BCC HEAs). The mechanistic attribution (\u201cBCC structure enables\u2026\u201d) also contradicts the known higher Peierls stress and DBTT issues in BCC. The corrosion claim is underspecified (environment/media not given), providing no adjudicable basis. While not fundamentally impossible in an absolute sense (isolated BCC metals like high-purity Ta can be very ductile, and elevated-temperature superplasticity exists), the specific >80% RT elongation and the comparative inversion (BCC > FCC) for a lightweight BCC HEA are probably wrong as stated.\n\nMinima that must hold:\n- Lightweight HEA that is BCC at test conditions.\n- >80% total elongation in tension under standard (implicit RT) conditions.\n- Ductility exceeding that of FCC or mixed-phase HEAs.\n- Greater corrosion resistance than the Ni alloys it replaces (in the relevant environment).\n\nEvidence mapping:\n- Direct/consensus: FCC HEAs show much higher RT ductility than BCC HEAs; BCC HEAs rarely approach even ~30% at RT; mechanism favors FCC ductility.\n- Contradictions: Claimed threshold (>80%) and comparative ordering (BCC > FCC) contradict established ranges/ordering.\n- Misaligned/underspecified: Corrosion comparison lacks environment/medium; cannot validate.\n\nWhy not \u20132:\n- Not a thermodynamic/structural impossibility in principle; extraordinary cases or non-RT conditions could, in theory, move ductility higher. The contradiction is quantitative and comparative under standard conditions rather than fundamentally forbidden.\n\nWhy not 0 or +1:\n- The totality of established data strongly disfavors both the numeric claim and the comparative ordering at RT; this is more than \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d and leans against feasibility.",
