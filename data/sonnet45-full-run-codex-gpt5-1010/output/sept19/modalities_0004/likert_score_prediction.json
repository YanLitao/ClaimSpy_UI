  "reasoning": "- \u20131 (Partially Infeasible) because PtSi is a known superconductor at ambient pressure with Tc \u2248 0.8\u20131.0 K, and the claim\u2019s specific numerical target (Tc = 3 K) is far outside established experimental values without condition\u2011matched evidence supporting such an enhancement.\n- Minima for the claim: (1) PtSi (stoichiometric) at ambient pressure, (2) prepared under some \u201cright conditions,\u201d (3) exhibits Tc = 3 K. All must hold.\n- Evidence: Multiple direct, condition\u2011matched studies (1994\u20132024) report PtSi Tc in 0.79\u20131.0 K; no reports at or near 3 K. The ~2 K gap greatly exceeds typical Tc measurement uncertainty, and variations across films/bulk/processing do not approach 3 K.\n- Why not \u20132: Not a fundamental impossibility; in principle, extreme strain, interfaces, or nonstoichiometry could alter Tc, but such scenarios are unsubstantiated here and would likely no longer be intrinsic PtSi.\n- Why not 0/+1/+2: Evidence is not merely insufficient; it consistently contradicts the claimed number. No positive, matched evidence supports Tc = 3 K.",
